### 2026-05-22 — Admin panel live data + credit requests + isTemplate + background preview

**Done**

*isTemplate redesign — dropped `subcategoryTemplates` table*

- `packages/db/src/schema/models.ts`: added `isTemplate boolean` to `modelPoses`; partial unique index `(subcategoryId, faceId, backgroundId) WHERE isTemplate=true`; removed `subcategoryTemplates` table
- Migration `0005_pose_istemplate_drop_templates.sql`: `ALTER TABLE model_poses ADD COLUMN is_template`; create index; `DROP TABLE subcategory_templates CASCADE`. Applied directly via `docker exec psql` (drizzle migration tracker only has entries 0+1; 2–5 must be applied manually)
- `packages/types/src/admin.ts`: `ConfirmModelPoseBody` + `PatchModelPoseBody` include `isTemplate`; all subcategory template schemas removed
- `apps/api/src/modules/admin/models.routes.ts`: `POST /poses/confirm` + `PATCH /poses/:id` unset previous template in cell before setting new one (transactional)
- `apps/api/src/modules/admin/subcategories.routes.ts`: `PATCH /subcategories/:id` enforces template coverage (every face×bg cell must have a template) when setting `isActive: true`
- `apps/api/src/server.ts`: removed `adminTemplatesRoutes` import + registration; deleted `templates.routes.ts`
- `BatchPoseUploadModal`: radio button per row to designate template at batch-upload time; default = first file
- `AssetsPage`: removed template tab/cards/state; "Set as template" button on non-template pose cards; pose cards show blue outline + badge when `isTemplate=true`; `templateCount` derived client-side

*Admin Users page — live data*

- `GET /admin/users`: `ilike` search on email/displayName, `total` count, left-join `userCredits` + `jobs` for `balance`/`totalJobs`/`lastJobAt`; excludes `passwordHash`
- `GET /admin/users/:id`: explicit field select (no passwordHash), flat response `{ ...user, balance, totalJobs, recentJobs }`
- `UsersPage.tsx`: replaced MOCK_USERS with `useEffect` + `apiFetch`; server-side search + pagination; suspend/unsuspend via `PATCH /admin/users/:id { isBanned }`; optimistic status update
- `User` type updated: `displayName`, `tier`, `isBanned`, `banReason`, `balance`, `totalJobs`, `lastJobAt`, `createdAt`; removed `name`/`plan`/`role`/`emailVerified`/`creditLimit`/`status`

*Credit Requests page (new)*

- `CreditRequestsPage.tsx`: tabs Pending / Approved / Rejected; approve modal (editable credits amount prefilled, optional admin note) → `PATCH /admin/credits/requests/:id/approve`; reject modal → `PATCH /admin/credits/requests/:id/reject`; reloads list after action
- Wired into `App.tsx` (`'credits'` page) and `Sidebar.tsx` (`Icon.Credit`, visible to SUPER_ADMIN + MODERATOR)

*Admin Jobs page — live data*

- `GET /admin/jobs`: `status` filter, `search` (job ID / user email), `total` count; multi-join for `userEmail`, `faceLabel`, `backgroundLabel`, `poseLabel`, `hasLower`, `hasShoe`, `outputUrl` (via storage.publicUrl)
- `GET /admin/jobs/:id`: same rich join + `userHint` from `jobInputs` + `events` array (flat response, not nested)
- `JobsPage.tsx`: replaced MOCK_JOBS with live fetch; status tab filter + search + pagination; detail view with events log; cancel → `POST .../cancel` with optimistic update; retry button on FAILED jobs → `POST .../retry`
- `Job` type: `userEmail`/timestamps/errorCode now `| null`; added `userId?`, `attempts?`

*User-facing background preview (template showcase)*

- `GET /v1/models/backgrounds`: accepts optional `subcategoryId`; when `faceId + subcategoryId` both provided fetches template poses (`isTemplate=true`) for face×subcategory, builds `backgroundId → thumbnailKey` map; response includes `previewUrl` = template pose composite thumbnail (falls back to raw bg thumbnail if no template set)
- `tryon/page.tsx`: `BackgroundItem` gets `previewUrl`; backgrounds query passes `subcategoryId`; background cards use `previewUrl`; step 2 description updated

**Failed / Not Done**

- Sidebar badge counts for jobs/credits are static (removed fake counts from users/jobs, credits has no live pending count yet)
- Dashboard page (`DashboardPage.tsx`) still uses MOCK_STATS — not converted to live data yet

**Open Questions / Decisions**

- [ ] Lower garment step in wizard: still not added (conditional on `pose.showsLower === true`)
- [ ] ComfyUI workflow template `templates/virtual-tryon-v1.json` still a stub — blocking E2E
- [ ] GPU VPS worker registration + dispatcher start — needed for E2E test

### 2026-05-21 — Frontend scaffold complete (Phase 3A+3B+3C) + backend schema fixes

**Done**

*`apps/web` — Next.js 15 App Router (full scaffold)*

- `package.json`: Next.js 15, React 19, Tailwind CSS 3, @tanstack/react-query, react-hook-form + zod resolvers, lucide-react, @radix-ui/react-slot
- `middleware.ts`: route protection via `access_token` cookie; redirects unauthenticated users to `/login?next=<path>`
- **Auth proxy routes** (`/api/auth/*`): Next.js route handlers proxy to API, extract refresh token from `Set-Cookie` response header, re-set as httpOnly cookie at `/api/auth` path; set `access_token` as JS-readable cookie at `/`
  - `/api/auth/login`, `/api/auth/register`, `/api/auth/logout`, `/api/auth/refresh`
- **Auth pages**: `/login`, `/register` — react-hook-form + zod validation, error display, Tailwind styling
- **App layout** (`/(app)/layout.tsx`): sticky navbar with credits balance (live via React Query), logout button, nav links
- **Dashboard** (`/dashboard`): job history list, status badges with icons, auto-refetch every 3s when active jobs exist
- **Try-On Wizard** (`/tryon`): 6-step wizard
  - Step 0: Gender + subcategory picker (loads `GET /v1/models/subcategories?gender=X`)
  - Step 1: Garment upload — XHR with progress bar, presign → direct R2 PUT
  - Step 2: Face selection — card grid (loads `GET /v1/models/faces?gender=X`)
  - Step 3: Background selection — card grid (loads `GET /v1/models/backgrounds`)
  - Step 4: Pose selection — card grid (loads `GET /v1/models/poses?subcategoryId=X&faceId=Y&backgroundId=Z`)
  - Step 5: Review + submit → `POST /v1/jobs/tryon` → redirect to job detail
- **Job detail** (`/jobs/[id]`): SSE live progress (EventSource), step indicator, result image with download button, failure state with refund notice
- **UI components**: Button (asChild/Radix Slot), Input, Badge (success/warning/processing/destructive variants), Navbar, Providers (React Query)
- **API client** (`lib/api.ts`): typed fetch wrapper, auto-refresh on 401, XHR upload with onprogress

*Backend fixes*

- `apps/api/src/modules/models/routes.ts` (NEW): user-facing model routes — `GET /v1/models/subcategories`, `/faces`, `/backgrounds`, `/poses`; requires auth, returns thumbnailUrl via `storage.publicUrl()`; registered in `server.ts`
- `apps/api/src/modules/jobs/create.ts`: rewrote to use new schema — validates `faceId`/`backgroundId`/`poseId` against `model_faces`/`model_backgrounds`/`model_poses` (was broken: still used old `modelCatalogId`/`catalogItems` references)
- `apps/dispatcher/src/job/processor.ts`: fixed r2Key resolution — now reads from `model_faces`/`model_backgrounds`/`model_poses` via `inputs.faceId`/`backgroundId`/`poseId` (was broken: used old `inputs.modelCatalogId` etc. against `catalogItems`)

**Failed / Not Done**

- SSE auth: job events endpoint uses `EventSource` which can't set custom headers; token passed as `?token=` query param in URL. API's `requireUser` plugin needs to support token from query string (not yet implemented — will silently fail on first SSE connect)
- No `CORS_ORIGIN` update for web port 3000 (`.env` still default; should be `http://localhost:3000` — already set)
- `apps/web` not in CORS_ORIGIN of API: need to confirm `CORS_ORIGIN=http://localhost:3000` in `.env`

**Decisions Made**

- Auth cookie strategy: `access_token` non-httpOnly (JS-readable, 15min) + `refresh` httpOnly at `/api/auth` path (7d). All managed by Next.js proxy routes.
- All API calls go direct from client to `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` (not through Next.js proxy), except auth. Avoids latency overhead.
- XHR (not fetch) for garment upload: enables `onprogress` events for progress bar.

**Open Questions / Decisions**

- [ ] SSE auth: `GET /v1/jobs/:id/events` uses `EventSource` (no custom headers). API `requireUser` only reads `Authorization` header. Need to add `?token=<accessToken>` query param support to `requireUser` plugin, or proxy SSE through Next.js.
- [ ] `CORS_ORIGIN` in `.env` must be `http://localhost:3000` for web ↔ API in dev — confirm set.
- [ ] `apps/web` prod: served via CloudPanel nginx on port 3000? Confirm routing before Phase 4D Dockerfile.
- [ ] Catalog lower garment selection not in wizard (Phase 3B only covers face/bg/pose). Add lower garment step if needed (wizard step 5, only shown when `pose.showsLower === true`).

### 2026-05-21 — Admin panel complete + asset management system

**Done**

*Admin Panel (`apps/admin` — standalone Vite/React SPA, proxied through Vite dev server at :5173)*

- **AssetsPage** — 3-tab layout: Backgrounds, Faces, Subcategories
  - Backgrounds tab: upload (presign → R2 PUT → confirm), toggle active, delete
  - Faces tab: upload with gender tag (men/women/boys/girls), toggle active, delete
  - Subcategories tab: create (proper modal, replaced `prompt()` dialogs), list with pose grid per subcategory
- **Pose management** — poses are per (subcategory × face × background) combo
  - Single-pose upload via UploadModal
  - Batch upload (`BatchPoseUploadModal`): select multiple files, assign shared face+bg+showsLower+showsShoes metadata, auto-label from filename stem, sequential upload with per-file status + retry
  - `EditPoseModal`: edit label, reassign faceId/backgroundId, showsLower, showsShoes, sortOrder — PATCH `/admin/assets/poses/:id`
  - Filter poses grid by face + background dropdowns
- **CatalogPage** — lower garments + shoes, thumbnail preview, toggle active, delete, upload
- **Real image thumbnails** — `AssetThumb` component: fetches `storagePublicUrl` from `/admin/me`, renders `<img>` using `thumbnailKey`; falls back to initials placeholder
- **AuthContext** — stores `storagePublicUrl: string | null`, propagated from `/admin/me` response, cleared on logout
- **Dark mode** — switch/toggle knob fixed (was hardcoded `#fff`, invisible on light track; now uses `var(--bg)`)
- **UploadModal** — added `placeholder` prop support for all field types

*DB / Types / API*

- `model_poses` schema: added `face_id` + `background_id` FK columns (migration `0003_poses_add_face_bg.sql`), applied to local Docker Postgres
- `packages/types`: `PresignModelPoseBody`, `ConfirmModelPoseBody` include `faceId`+`backgroundId`; `PatchModelPoseBody` has optional `faceId`+`backgroundId`
- `/admin/assets/poses` GET: optional `faceId`/`backgroundId` query filters
- `/admin/me` response: includes `storagePublicUrl` from env
- `packages/storage/r2.ts`: fixed two AWS SDK v3 presigned URL bugs
  - Removed `ContentLength` from `PutObjectCommand` (was signing content-length header, causing `SignatureDoesNotMatch` when file size differed from hardcoded 10MB)
  - Added `requestChecksumCalculation: 'WHEN_REQUIRED'` + `responseChecksumValidation: 'WHEN_REQUIRED'` (disabled CRC32 checksum query params MinIO doesn't support)

**Failed / Not Done**

- Admin panel built as separate Vite SPA (`apps/admin`), not embedded in Next.js (`apps/web`) — diverges from PHASES.md §3D plan. This is intentional: admin panel is ready for production use standalone; no plan to migrate.
- `apps/web` (user-facing Next.js try-on builder) — not started
- Phase 2B (VPS + Tunnel + ComfyUI) — not started
- `templates/virtual-tryon-v1.json` — still a stub; real ComfyUI workflow export still blocking E2E

**Decisions Made**

- Admin panel = standalone Vite SPA (`apps/admin`) — not part of `apps/web`. Deployed separately, proxied by nginx in prod.
- Asset management scope expanded beyond original PHASES.md §1D: model faces, backgrounds, garment subcategories, poses all fully managed via admin UI.
- Poses schema: face × background per pose (not just per subcategory) — data model locked.
- Presigned URL upload flow: browser → presign API → direct PUT to MinIO/R2 → confirm API. Confirmed working end-to-end with local MinIO.

**Open Questions / Decisions**

- [ ] `apps/admin` prod deployment: serves from same VPS as API? nginx route `/admin-app/*` → static files from `apps/admin/dist/`? Decide before Phase 4D.
- [ ] Subcategory template images (`subcategory_templates` table — pre-rendered face×background composites): does admin need UI to upload these? Currently table exists but no admin page for it.
- [ ] Pose `subcategoryId` is required on upload — does every pose belong to exactly one subcategory, or should poses be subcategory-agnostic (shared across subcategories)? Current model: one subcategory per pose. Confirm with product.

### 2026-05-19 — Dispatcher test fixes

**Done**
- Fixed postgres module resolution: added `resolve.alias` in `apps/dispatcher/vitest.config.ts` (Vite couldn't resolve `postgres` from non-hoisted pnpm layout)
- Fixed worker registry test isolation: `registerWorkers` now always updates (removed `if (!existing)` guard), added `deregisterWorker` called in all test `afterAll` blocks
- Fixed `recoverPendingJobs`: added optional `streams` param (defaults to `['jobs:priority', 'jobs:normal']`), handles NOGROUP gracefully
- Fixed recovery test: passes custom stream to `recoverPendingJobs` instead of expecting hardcoded streams
- Removed duplicate `export { schema }` from `packages/db/src/index.ts`
- All 3 dispatcher integration test suites pass: happy-path, retry, recovery
- Added `README.md` with architecture, stack, setup, commands, project status
- Pushed all changes to GitHub (`adeshboudh/aivastra`)

**Failed / Not Done**
- `templates/virtual-tryon-v1.json` still a stub — real ComfyUI workflow export needed
- VPS provisioning (Phase 2B) not started
- Phase 3 (`apps/web` Next.js frontend) not started

**Open Questions / Decisions**
- [ ] ComfyUI workflow: which node IDs map to each `__AIVASTRA_*__` placeholder? Need real workflow export first
- [ ] Worker hostname naming: `WORKER_A_URL` / `WORKER_B_URL` vs `WORKER_<ID>_URL` — decide convention before Phase 2B
- [ ] Catalog key resolution still happens in dispatcher via DB join (deviation from CLAUDE.md invariant) — add r2Key columns to `job_inputs` in v2 migration?

### 2026-05-19 — Phase 2 dispatcher plan written

**Done**
- Detailed implementation plan written at `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-05-19-phase-2-dispatcher.md`
- Plan covers 20 tasks: package scaffold, env validation, lib layer, worker registry + health monitor + selector, workflow patcher, ComfyUI HTTP + WebSocket client, job state machine + processor, stream consumer, crash recovery, health server, entry point, test harness + 3 integration test suites, Dockerfile
- Workflow template stub created at `templates/virtual-tryon-v1.json` (placeholder markers defined)

**Failed / Not Done**
- Implementation not started — plan only
- `templates/virtual-tryon-v1.json` is a stub; real ComfyUI workflow export still needed (blocking for Phase 4 E2E)
- VPS provisioning (Phase 2B) not covered in code plan — infra-only, see `infra/cloudflared/README.md`

**Open Questions / Decisions**
- [ ] **BLOCKING:** Real ComfyUI workflow export needed — set up ComfyUI on dev VPS, build workflow, export as API format, map node IDs to `__AIVASTRA_*__` placeholders in template
- [ ] Catalog key resolution deviation: `job_inputs` stores catalog UUIDs, not r2Keys — dispatcher must join `catalog_items`. Consider adding r2Key columns to `job_inputs` in v2 migration
- [ ] Hostinger GPU VPS specs not finalized — confirm plan availability before provisioning (see PHASES.md §2B)
- [ ] `WORKER_IDS` env var naming: `worker-a,worker-b` requires `WORKER_A_URL` and `WORKER_B_URL` env vars — confirm naming convention matches real worker hostnames

### 2026-05-18 — Initial scaffolding (api + packages)

**Done**
- Monorepo structure created: `apps/api`, `packages/db`, `packages/types`, `packages/storage`, `packages/logger`
- Drizzle schema + migrations wired in `packages/db`
- Fastify API with all `/v1/*` and `/admin/*` routes: users, credits, catalog, jobs, workers, config
- JWT auth + admin double-check guard (`admin_users` row lookup)
- Redis Streams job enqueue (`jobs:priority`, `jobs:normal`)
- SSE job events via Redis pub/sub with 15s heartbeat
- Integration test suite: per-test Postgres DB + MinIO bucket isolation, no testcontainers
- Parallel test isolation fixed for db + redis + minio
- Production Dockerfile + e2e smoke test

**Failed / Not Done**
- `apps/dispatcher` — not yet built (Redis Stream consumer, ComfyUI bridge, worker health monitor)
- `apps/web` — not yet scaffolded
- `packages/catalog` — category tree builder not yet extracted
- `scripts/seed-catalog.ts` — not yet written
- Cloudflare Tunnel / `cloudflared` infra config
- ComfyUI workflow templates in `templates/`

**Open Questions / Decisions**
- [ ] Dispatcher: retry strategy — max 2 attempts then refund. Confirm dead-letter stream key name.
- [ ] Web: Next.js 15 App Router vs Pages Router for admin panel?
- [ ] Presigned URL expiry for garment uploads — how long?
- [ ] Worker health TTL is 30s (probed every 15s) — adjust if ComfyUI startup is slow?
- [ ] `packages/catalog` — extract from api routes now or after dispatcher?
- [ ] MinIO bucket naming convention for prod R2 (single bucket with prefixes vs per-env buckets)?

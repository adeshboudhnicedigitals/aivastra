# Project Progress

## 2026-06-30 — Saree node detector

### Done
- Created `apps/api/src/modules/admin/saree-detect.ts` mirroring `tryon-detect.ts` structure with saree-specific title matching (`garment`/`saree`/`flatsaree` for the user image, `person`/`model` for the admin/static image).
- Created `apps/api/src/modules/admin/saree-detect.test.ts` with 5 inline-fixture tests covering: model/saree image detection, output node detection, positive/negative prompt detection via connection scan, default prompt text extraction, and the empty-JSON null case.
- TDD: test failed with `Cannot find module './saree-detect.js'` before implementation; all 5 tests pass after.
- `pnpm --filter @aivastra/api typecheck` clean.
- Committed: `feat(api): add saree node detector` (4cfed73).

### Failed / Not Done
- None.

### Open Questions / Decisions
- Pre-existing unresolved conflict marker (`<<<<<<< Updated upstream` with no closer) at the top of `docs/progress.md` — left untouched, outside the scope of this task.

<<<<<<< Updated upstream
## 2026-06-24 — Premium dark mode Task 5: refine tokens.css palettes and remove hardcoded colors

### Done
- Updated `:root` light palette in `apps/admin/src/styles/tokens.css`:
  - Replaced `--surface: #ffffff` with `oklch(0.99 0.005 80)`.
  - Reordered semantic status variables so each status group keeps base/soft/ink/border together.
- Updated `[data-theme="dark"]` to warm charcoal (`hue 55`):
  - Darkened `--bg`/`--surface`/`--surface-2`/`--surface-hover` and adjusted all greys to hue 55.
  - Warmed and balanced accent, success, warn, danger, and info values.
  - Updated shadow tints to hue 55.
- Replaced six hardcoded color usages with CSS variables:
  - `.status-dot::before` box-shadow now uses `var(--success-soft)`.
  - `.nav-item.alert .count` text now uses `var(--bg)`.
  - `.brand-mark` text now uses `var(--accent-ink)`.
  - `.role-pill` text now uses `var(--accent-ink)`.
  - `.inactive-overlay` now uses `var(--surface)` with `opacity: 0.5`.
  - `.imgpv-cap` background/text now uses `var(--ink)` / `var(--bg)`.
- Replaced the `html` transition block with `background-color`, `color`, `border-color`, and `box-shadow` transitions.
- Verified `pnpm --filter @aivastra/admin lint` passes (warnings are pre-existing).
- Verified `pnpm --filter @aivastra/admin build` succeeds.
- Committed: `feat(admin): warm-charcoal dark palette and remove hardcoded colors`.

### Failed / Not Done
- None.

### Open Questions / Decisions
- None.

## 2026-06-24 — Premium dark mode Task 4: remove local theme state from App.tsx

### Done
- Removed the local `Theme` type and `readInitialTheme()` helper from `apps/admin/src/App.tsx`.
- Replaced local `useState` theme state with `useTheme()` from `./context/ThemeContext`.
- Removed the `useEffect` that synced `data-theme` and `localStorage`; `ThemeProvider` now owns that.
- Removed the local `toggleTheme` `useCallback`.
- Updated `settingsProps` to pass `theme` and `setTheme`.
- Left the `<Topbar ... />` call unchanged as instructed.
- Updated `apps/admin/src/pages/SettingsPage.tsx` to accept the new `Theme`/`setTheme` props and toggle using `resolvedTheme` from `useTheme()`; this was required to keep the TypeScript build passing after changing `settingsProps`.
- Applied Biome formatting/import ordering fixes required by the lefthook pre-commit hook.
- Verified `pnpm --filter @aivastra/admin build` succeeds with no TypeScript errors.
- Committed: `refactor(admin): App.tsx consumes useTheme instead of owning theme state`.

### Failed / Not Done
- None.

### Open Questions / Decisions
- The task description listed only `apps/admin/src/App.tsx` as modified, but `SettingsPage.tsx` also had to be updated because the new `settingsProps` no longer provides `onToggleTheme`. Task 8 was originally scoped to update `SettingsPage` props; the necessary prop change was pulled forward to keep the build green.
- `toggleTheme` from `useTheme()` was not destructured in `App.tsx` because it has no consumer until Task 7 wires it into `Topbar`; destructuring it now would trigger `noUnusedLocals`.

## 2026-06-24 — Premium dark mode Task 3: wire ThemeProvider into main.tsx

### Done
- Updated `apps/admin/src/main.tsx` to import `ThemeProvider` from `./context/ThemeContext.tsx`.
- Wrapped `<App />` with `<ThemeProvider>` inside `<AuthProvider>` so `useAuth()` is available to `ThemeProvider` and `useTheme()` is available throughout the app.
- Verified `pnpm --filter @aivastra/admin build` succeeds with no TypeScript errors.
- Committed: `feat(admin): wrap App with ThemeProvider`.

### Failed / Not Done
- None.

### Open Questions / Decisions
- None.

## 2026-06-24 — Premium dark mode Task 2: create ThemeProvider context

### Done
- Created `apps/admin/src/context/ThemeContext.tsx` with `ThemeProvider` and `useTheme` hook.
- Implemented localStorage persistence via `aivastra-theme`, system-preference listening, and server preference sync via `/admin/me` and `/admin/me/preferences`.
- Ensured the server-preference fetch waits for `!isLoading` to avoid duplicating `/admin/me` calls already made by `AuthProvider.fetchRole()`.
- Applied Biome formatting/import ordering fixes required by the lefthook pre-commit hook.
- Verified `pnpm --filter @aivastra/admin build` succeeds with no TypeScript errors.
- Committed: `feat(admin): add ThemeProvider with system preference and server sync`.

### Failed / Not Done
- None.

### Open Questions / Decisions
- None.

## 2026-06-24 — Premium dark mode Task 1: expose `isAuthenticated` from AuthContext

### Done
- Added `isAuthenticated: boolean` to the `AuthState` interface in `apps/admin/src/context/AuthContext.tsx`.
- Provided `isAuthenticated: !!token` in the `AuthContext.Provider` value object.
- Verified `pnpm --filter @aivastra/admin build` succeeds with no TypeScript errors.
- Committed: `feat(admin): expose isAuthenticated from AuthContext`.

## 2026-06-24 — Add $type annotation to admin_users preferences

### Done
- Added `.$type<{ theme?: 'light' | 'dark' | 'system' }>()` annotation to `preferences` jsonb column in `packages/db/src/schema/admin.ts`.
- Verified builds pass for both `@aivastra/db` and `@aivastra/api`.
- Migration `0059_admin_preferences.sql` already existed from prior commit.

### Failed / Not Done
- None.

### Open Questions / Decisions
- None.

## 2026-06-24 — Comprehensive codebase reference document

### Done
- Analysed the entire Aivastra monorepo: apps (api, dispatcher, web, admin, admin-mobile), packages (db, types, storage, logger, observability), infra, tests, and docs.
- Created `docs/codebase-reference.md` as an internal reference covering architecture, stack, monorepo layout, DB schema, API/dispatcher/web/admin details, testing, env vars, deployment, invariants, and key files.

### Failed / Not Done
- Repository-wide `pnpm lint` still reports pre-existing errors/warnings unrelated to the new document (`.opencode/plugins/graphify.js`, `apps/admin/src/components/`, `scripts/seed-admin.ts`, `biome.json` config).

### Open Questions / Decisions
- Whether to keep `docs/codebase-reference.md` as a living document and how frequently it should be refreshed after large architectural changes.

## 2026-06-15 - Admin mobile Android emulator ABI fix

### Done
- Diagnosed the `libreactnative.so` startup crash as an ABI mismatch: the debug APK was being built for `arm64-v8a` only and then installed on an `x86_64` emulator.
- Updated the generated Android Gradle properties to package both `arm64-v8a` and `x86_64` for local testing.

### Failed / Not Done
- The APK has not been rebuilt after the ABI fix in this turn.

### Open Questions / Decisions
- If you want faster physical-device-only debug builds later, the ABI list can be narrowed back to `arm64-v8a` before release packaging.

## 2026-06-15 — Admin mobile EAS Android autolinking fix

### Done
- Diagnosed the EAS Java failure as Expo SDK 53 running with pnpm isolated dependencies, which Expo documents as unsupported for reliable native builds.
- Switched the workspace to pnpm's hoisted linker and pinned React/React DOM runtime and type versions for deterministic monorepo resolution.
- Added the required direct `expo-font` and `expo-linking` native peer dependencies and ignored local `.expo` state.
- Verified Android autolinking now emits `import expo.modules.ExpoModulesPackage;` instead of the invalid `expo.core` import.
- Verified Expo Doctor 18/18, admin-mobile typecheck, web-admin production build, and Android Hermes export.

### Failed / Not Done
- The corrected EAS cloud APK build has not yet been submitted; the next build should use `--clear-cache` to discard the failed build's native cache.

### Open Questions / Decisions
- Expo SDK 54+ supports isolated pnpm installs; the workspace can reconsider `nodeLinker: hoisted` during a future SDK upgrade.

## 2026-06-15 — Admin mobile EAS project linking

### Done
- Linked the dynamic Expo configuration to EAS project `c1c815e3-1a59-4965-874f-c494e08702b2` with an environment override option.
- Set EAS CLI app-version handling to local, removing the upcoming `cli.appVersionSource` warning.
- Verified the resolved Expo config contains the EAS project ID and current Wi-Fi API/storage URLs.
- Verified admin-mobile typecheck, EAS JSON parsing, and diff whitespace.

### Failed / Not Done
- The cloud APK build has not yet been retried after linking; it requires the authenticated user command.

### Open Questions / Decisions
- App version remains `0.0.0`, which is acceptable for this internal preview but must be raised before production distribution.

## 2026-06-14 — Admin mobile Wi-Fi APK preview setup

### Done
- Added an EAS `preview` profile that produces an internally distributed Android APK.
- Configured the preview APK for the current Wi-Fi host `192.168.29.54` on API port 4000 and MinIO port 9000.
- Added storage URL propagation through Expo config and made the MinIO host binding configurable without exposing Postgres or Redis.
- Updated ignored local environment files for physical-device API and storage access.
- Verified mobile typecheck, `eas.json` parsing, Docker Compose configuration, and diff whitespace.

### Failed / Not Done
- MinIO recreation and endpoint reachability checks could not run because Docker Desktop was not running.
- Windows Firewall access for TCP ports 4000 and 9000 still needs confirmation from the physical phone.

### Open Questions / Decisions
- The Wi-Fi IP is embedded in the preview profile and must be updated if the computer receives a different DHCP address.

## 2026-06-14 — Admin mobile production-readiness audit

### Done
- Audited Android release configuration, environment handling, authentication persistence, tests, and observability.
- Confirmed feature implementation and Hermes export are complete, but production release infrastructure and device QA are still pending.
- Identified auth lifecycle risks: foreground bootstrap failure does not clear the in-memory access token, and API refresh does not update the Zustand token used by SSE/navigation.

### Failed / Not Done
- No EAS build profiles, signed release build verification, automated mobile tests, crash reporting, analytics, or staged rollout configuration exist yet.
- Production API/storage environment validation and full emulator/physical-device regression testing are not complete.

### Open Questions / Decisions
- Select the production distribution path (Google Play internal testing/EAS or native Gradle CI), crash-reporting provider, and automated device-test framework.

## 2026-06-14 — Admin mobile Phase 8 operations and configuration

### Done
- Implemented the Workers screen against the actual keyed Redis registry response, with health parsing, pull-to-refresh, and 30-second polling.
- Implemented SUPER_ADMIN credit-plan CRUD using the live `slug`, `name`, `subtext`, credits, paise price, badge, highlight, active, and sort-order schema.
- Added safe handling for successful `204 No Content` API mutations, required by credit-plan deletion.
- Implemented the SUPER_ADMIN system-config form for the actual `creditCostPerJob` and `maxJobsPerDay` fields, including dirty-state detection and guarded refresh.
- Registered and wired Workers, Credit Plans, and System Config routes, completing the More menu navigation map.
- Verified admin-mobile typecheck, source diff checks, theme/log audits, and a clean Android Hermes export.

### Failed / Not Done
- Worker GPU utilization, VRAM usage, and true active-job counts are not displayed because the current worker registry API does not publish those fields.
- Emulator interaction QA remains for polling, credit-plan create/edit/delete conflict behavior, and config dirty-refresh confirmation.

### Open Questions / Decisions
- The worker screen derives a single active slot from `status === 'BUSY'`; richer GPU/job metrics require a backend registry contract extension.
- The current config API exposes only credit cost and daily job limit; maintenance mode, default credits, per-user limits, and retry limits are not implemented server-side.

## 2026-06-13 — Admin mobile Phase 7 workflows and recycle bin

### Done
- Added typed workflow list and detail routes with active state, metadata, node IDs, prompts, and pose counts.
- Added role-gated workflow label/status editing, pose reassignment, and conflict-aware deletion.
- Added grouped recycle-bin sections for faces, backgrounds, and pose assets with accessible selection controls.
- Added restore, role-gated permanent deletion, and confirmed empty-bin operations with refreshed server state.
- Wired Workflows and Recycle Bin into the More stack and menu with backend-aligned role restrictions.
- Verified admin-mobile typecheck, source diff checks, theme/log audits, and a clean Android Hermes export.

### Failed / Not Done
- Emulator interaction QA remains for workflow reassignment, conflict deletion, grouped restore, and empty-bin behavior.
- Workflow creation and JSON/node mapping remain web-admin-only by design.

### Open Questions / Decisions
- Empty-bin requests are grouped by asset type because the API accepts one recycle type per request; partial failures trigger a refresh and explicit warning.

## 2026-06-13 — Admin mobile Phase 6 catalog

### Done
- Fixed the Phase 5 pose-asset mapping contract by carrying `garmentTypeId` into pose-detail navigation.
- Fixed the garment-type detail loading state for dark theme and normalized the screen into maintainable source formatting.
- Added the Catalog route stack, More-menu navigation, lower-garment/shoe tabs, category-aware rows, and image upload/create flow.
- Added catalog item detail editing for label, gender, active state, sort order, and garment-type assignments, with role-gated deletion.
- Verified admin-mobile typecheck, source diff checks, theme/log audits, and a clean Android Hermes export.

### Failed / Not Done
- Emulator interaction QA remains for MinIO image display, catalog uploads, assignment changes, and deletion.
- Catalog category reassignment remains web-admin-only because the mobile Phase 6 scope specifies read-only category display.

### Open Questions / Decisions
- Catalog detail falls back to the `lower` endpoint if opened without a type parameter; normal in-app navigation always provides the item type.

## 2026-06-13 — Admin mobile Phase 5 assets

### Done
- Applied the Phase 4 review cleanup by resolving face/background thumbnail URLs once per detail render.
- Added reusable searchable picker modal infrastructure.
- Implemented garment type list/create/detail flows, JPEG thumbnail upload, active/lower-upload toggles, pose navigation, conflict handling, and role-gated deletion.
- Implemented garment-type pose grid/detail flows with active filtering, bulk delete, prompt/order/workflow editing, and force-delete confirmation for referenced jobs.
- Implemented pose asset library, multi-image creation uploads, metadata/mapping detail, garment-type mapping, bulk soft delete, and force-delete confirmation.
- Verified mobile typecheck and a clean Android Hermes export for all Phase 5 routes.

### Failed / Not Done
- Existing garment-type slugs are read-only because the current `PatchGarmentTypeBody` API does not accept `slug`.
- Emulator interaction QA remains for multi-image upload progress, picker selection, mapping, activation conflicts, and force-delete flows.

### Open Questions / Decisions
- Pose-asset gender and face/background/workflow reassignment can be expanded in a follow-up refinement; creation currently requires existing face, background, and workflow selections.

## 2026-06-13 — Admin mobile Phase 4 asset hub

### Done
- Verified local `master` matches remote HEAD `ec18526`; no pull or conflict resolution was required.
- Added emulator-safe storage URL handling, thumbnail generation, progress-aware XHR uploads, two-image upload confirmation, and JPEG-only thumbnail uploads.
- Added reusable themed image picker, upload progress, square asset card, and horizontal asset row components.
- Converted the Assets tab from a flat placeholder into a nested asset hub with live counts.
- Implemented Faces and Backgrounds list grids with gender filtering, pull-to-refresh, selection mode, role-gated bulk soft delete, and upload forms.
- Implemented Face and Background detail editing, active/white-background toggles, role-gated deletion, and 409 conflict messaging.
- Added `canDeleteAssets()` and the Expo SDK-compatible `expo-image` dependency.
- Verified mobile typecheck and a clean Android Hermes export with the nested Phase 4 routes.

### Failed / Not Done
- Phases 5–8 remain pending; they were not compressed into the Phase 4 change because each phase requires separate end-to-end API and emulator validation.

### Open Questions / Decisions
- Local Android emulator storage uses `http://10.0.2.2:9000/aivastra`; physical devices need a LAN-reachable MinIO URL instead.

## 2026-06-13 — Admin mobile Phase 3 review cleanup

### Done
- Consolidated user avatar initials formatting into the shared `format.ts` utility and updated list/detail consumers.
- Reviewed proposed future More stack registrations against Expo Router behavior.

### Failed / Not Done
- Did not register nonexistent workflows, recycle-bin, settings, or config routes because Expo Router emits unmatched-screen warnings; each registration will be added with its route implementation.

### Open Questions / Decisions
- None.

## 2026-06-13 — Admin mobile Phase 2 refinement and Phase 3 Users

### Done
- Added a global Zustand toast queue with animated success/error/warning/info cards, three-toast limit, manual dismissal, and automatic dismissal.
- Mounted toast rendering at the root and wired job cancel/retry success feedback.
- Added reusable paginated data loading and imperative confirmation helpers.
- Added theme-aware user rows, credit grant page-sheet modal, debounced searchable users list, and paginated refresh/loading/error states.
- Added user detail with profile metrics, recent jobs, role-gated credit grants, ban/unban, session revocation, and super-admin soft delete.
- Converted the More route into a nested stack, wired More → Users and Dashboard Active Users → Users navigation.
- Removed the final direct dark/light palette usage from mobile UI components; runtime colors now come from `useAppTheme()`.
- Verified mobile typecheck, source diff formatting, Expo Router route discovery, and a clean Android Hermes export.

### Failed / Not Done
- Emulator interaction checks for grant, ban/unban, delete, and toast timing require authenticated test users and remain manual QA.

### Open Questions / Decisions
- The backend user-detail endpoint currently returns a partial object instead of HTTP 404 for an unknown UUID; the mobile screen defensively treats missing `id` or `email` as not found.

## 2026-06-13 — Admin mobile Material 3 Expressive redesign

### Done
- Added a semantic light/dark Material-inspired color system, expressive shape scale, elevated glass surfaces, and persisted `system` / `light` / `dark` appearance modes.
- Rebuilt the dashboard as a bento command center with a featured metric, compact supporting cards, worker pulse, attention queues, and expressive seven-day chart.
- Added smart admin search shortcuts for failed, queued, and generating jobs, worker navigation, and direct pasted job-ID navigation.
- Replaced text glyph navigation with Material Community icons and a floating rounded bottom navigation surface.
- Redesigned login and More/profile screens, including a three-way appearance selector.
- Migrated jobs list/detail, cards, filters, statuses, accordions, timelines, empty states, and skeletons to dynamic semantic colors.
- Added `@expo/vector-icons` as a direct mobile dependency and verified mobile typecheck, Expo dependency compatibility, and clean diff formatting.

### Failed / Not Done
- Smart search is an intent-based local command router, not an LLM-backed assistant; conversational API integration remains future scope.
- Assets remains a Phase 4 placeholder and More menu routes remain tied to later implementation phases.

### Open Questions / Decisions
- Emulator QA should verify floating navigation safe-area spacing, glass opacity in both themes, small-screen bento wrapping, and keyboard behavior on login/search.

## 2026-06-13 — Admin mobile Phase 2 UI polish

### Done
- Added reusable animated `SkeletonLoader`, `EmptyState`, `AccordionSection`, and Android-capable pinch/drag `ImagePreview` components.
- Replaced initial dashboard and jobs-list spinners with layout-matched skeleton states.
- Replaced percentage chart heights with numeric Android-safe bar heights.
- Added collapsible job-detail sections, fullscreen input/output image previews, and started/completed timestamps.
- Added expandable event payload JSON with clipboard copy feedback using `expo-clipboard`.
- Added explicit 404 job-not-found handling and per-action cancel/retry loading indicators.
- Verified Expo dependencies, mobile typecheck, and a clean Android bundle with `--max-workers 1`.

### Failed / Not Done
- Active Users stat-card navigation remains deferred until the Phase 3 Users route exists.

### Open Questions / Decisions
- Emulator QA should verify pinch/drag bounds, accordion ergonomics, and chart appearance with real dashboard data.

## 2026-06-13 — Remote synchronization before mobile work

### Done
- Fetched and fast-forwarded `master` from `ce49477` to remote HEAD `ec18526` after stashing all staged, unstaged, and untracked local work.
- Restored local mobile work after the pull with no merge conflicts.
- Confirmed remote commit `a6bf082` split the large admin `AssetsPage.tsx` into per-tab components.
- Confirmed remote commit `ff39751` removed the root `assets/` directory from Git tracking; the pull removed those formerly tracked local copies, and the existing `assets/*` rule prevents future re-addition.

### Failed / Not Done
- None.

### Open Questions / Decisions
- Local changes are intentionally left uncommitted and unpushed.

## 2026-06-13 — Admin mobile pending-work audit

### Done
- Audited the current route tree and implementation against `admin-mobile-phase2-plus-plan.md` after successful Android emulator startup.
- Confirmed Auth, Dashboard, Jobs list, and Job detail are functional foundations; Assets remains a placeholder and More menu items are not wired.
- Confirmed Phases 3–8 and their shared infrastructure are not implemented.

### Failed / Not Done
- No implementation changes were made; this entry records scope only.

### Open Questions / Decisions
- Prioritize Phase 3 Users next, or complete remaining Phase 2 UX/polish gaps before starting new administration domains.
- Node 20 LTS remains recommended for Expo SDK 53; Node 24 requires reduced Metro worker counts locally.

## 2026-06-12 — Admin mobile Expo startup fix

### Done
- Converted `app.config.js` to ESM and renamed CommonJS Metro/Babel configuration files to `.cjs` so they load correctly under the package's `"type": "module"` setting.
- Added `@babel/runtime` as a direct mobile dependency and updated Metro's pnpm monorepo watch/resolution paths to include the workspace root.
- Corrected the Expo Router entry point from legacy `expo/AppEntry.js` to `expo-router/entry`.
- Aligned React, React Native, Expo Router, and native Expo modules to the Expo SDK 53 compatibility set; added required Router and SecureStore config plugins.
- Audited the full workspace React graph (18.3.1, 19.0.0, and 19.2.6 coexist by design), pinned mobile React exactly to 19.0.0, and forced Metro's mobile React/React Native resolutions to the app-local dependency graph without globally overriding other workspaces.
- Verified with a clean Android source-map export that the mobile bundle contains only `react@19.0.0`.
- Removed import-time `Intl.RelativeTimeFormat` and `Intl.NumberFormat` usage from shared mobile formatters for Hermes compatibility; declared the Assets tab unconditionally and hide it with `href: null` to satisfy Expo Router layout child requirements.
- Confirmed the Hermes-safe mobile bundle succeeds with a single Metro worker; Node 24's multi-worker export path remains unstable, so Node 20 or `--max-workers 1` is recommended for local Expo development.

### Failed / Not Done
- None.

### Open Questions / Decisions
- Android emulator UI and networking still require runtime verification after Metro starts.

## 2026-06-12 — Admin mobile Phase 2 jobs flow

### Done
- Replaced the jobs tab placeholder with a nested stack, paginated job list, URL-derived initial filter, pull-to-refresh, infinite loading, global SSE badge updates, and 15-second polling fallback after stream errors.
- Added `EventTimeline` using `JobEvent.eventType`; worker and error details are read from `event.payload`.
- Added `useAdminJobStream` as a typed `useSSE` wrapper that filters the global admin stream by job ID and reconnects when the route job changes.
- Added the `JobDetail` screen with live optimistic timeline events, job metadata, input/output images, and role-safe cancel/retry actions.
- Corrected stuck-job identifiers on the dashboard to use neutral text instead of error red.
- Confirmed job events are returned newest-first; retained live-event prepending and cleared optimistic events before completion refetches to prevent duplicates.

### Failed / Not Done
- None.

### Open Questions / Decisions
- The dashboard percentage-height bar chart still needs a device or simulator visual check before release.
- `/admin/jobs/stream` is global and does not support server-side job filtering; the detail hook filters events client-side.

## 2026-06-12 — Admin mobile worker card

### Done
- Added `accessible` to `StatusBadge` so its explicit screen-reader label is used.
- Added `WorkerCard` using the real `DashboardWorker` payload: worker ID, health-derived status, and relative last-seen time.
- Kept unhealthy workers visually and semantically offline; did not invent the stale plan's unavailable GPU field.
- Consolidated status-label formatting in `lib/format.ts` for reuse by worker and job UI components.
- Added a typed, reusable horizontal `FilterChips` control and the six plan-defined job filters; transient `PREPROCESSING` and `UPLOADING` remain under `All` only.
- Removed the ineffective accessibility label from the filter `ScrollView`; individual chips retain button roles and selected state announcements.
- Added `JobCard` with the plan-defined status, user, shortened job ID, credit cost, and relative creation time layout.
- Humanized the job status in `JobCard` accessibility announcements to match the visible badge label.
- Replaced the dashboard placeholder with the full `/admin/stats` view: 30-second polling, pull-to-refresh, six stat cards, seven-day chart, direct `DashboardWorker[]` rendering, recent failures, and stuck jobs.
- Applied failed-job alert styling only when `failed24h` is non-zero and added an all-workers-offline warning.

### Failed / Not Done
- None.

### Validation
- `pnpm --filter @aivastra/admin-mobile typecheck`
- `git diff --check -- apps/admin-mobile/src/components/StatusBadge.tsx apps/admin-mobile/src/components/WorkerCard.tsx`

### Open Questions / Decisions
- The plan's `WorkerCard` GPU comment is stale because `/admin/stats` does not return GPU data.
- `PREPROCESSING` and `UPLOADING` jobs are intentionally reachable only through the `All` filter, which may make targeted transient-state investigation slower during QA.

## Log

### 2026-06-12 — Admin Mobile Phase 2 shared prerequisites

**Done:**
- Added `apps/admin-mobile/src/types.ts` with the shared admin domain types and
  Phase 2 dashboard, job detail, pagination, and SSE event contracts.
- Added `src/lib/sse.ts` with an authenticated fetch-based SSE reader, multiline
  event parsing, heartbeat tolerance, cleanup, and bounded reconnect backoff.
- Added `src/lib/format.ts` with relative time, date, and Indian-locale number
  formatting helpers.
- Added `src/hooks/useApi.ts` with loading, error, refresh, stale-request, unmount,
  disabled-query, and React Strict Mode handling.
- Added `src/hooks/useSSE.ts` with auth-token wiring and automatic connection cleanup.
- Consolidated mobile `AdminRole` usage onto the shared type definition.
- Verified `pnpm --filter @aivastra/admin-mobile typecheck` passes with zero errors.
- Added `src/components/StatCard.tsx` for Phase 2 dashboard metrics, including
  optional navigation, alert styling, subtitles, formatted values, hidden null
  deltas, and neutral zero-delta rendering without an arrow.
- Verified `/admin/stats` deltas are percentage changes, already multiplied by 100
  and rounded by the API; `StatCard` therefore retains the `%` suffix. Its props now
  enforce delta/subtitle exclusivity, and delta text uses the shared sans typography.
- Added `src/components/StatusBadge.tsx` with compact/full-width variants, status
  dots, the seven documented job-state colors, accessible labels, and a resilient
  gray fallback for unknown future states.

**Failed / Not Done:**
- Remaining Phase 2 components and screens were not started; this entry covers plan
  §2.2 steps 1–6 and reordered step 8 (`StatusBadge`) before `WorkerCard`.

**Open Questions / Decisions:**
- SSE reconnects currently reuse the same access token. If the stream is the only
  active request when that token expires, 401 responses retry with backoff until
  another app action refreshes the token. Add SSE-triggered refresh handling in a
  later Phase 2+ pass.
- `useApi()` is intentionally GET-only for current Phase 2 dashboard/list queries.
  Extend it or add a mutation hook before Phase 3+ form submissions need request
  methods or bodies.

---

### 2026-06-12 — Admin Mobile auth error handling + documentation corrections

**Done:**
- Fixed `apps/admin-mobile/src/store/auth.ts`: login error parsing now reads
  `body.error.code` (matching the API's `{ error: { code, message } }` envelope).
  `EMAIL_NOT_VERIFIED` (403) surfaces as a dedicated error; all other login failures
  (wrong password, non-admin, inactive admin) surface as `INVALID_CREDENTIALS`.
- Fixed `apps/admin-mobile/src/app/(auth)/login.tsx`: shows "Email not verified —
  check your inbox" for `EMAIL_NOT_VERIFIED`; removed dead `NOT_ADMIN` branch (the
  new `login-mobile` returns 401 for non-admins, not 403).
- Corrected `docs/admin-mobile-implementation-report.md` §1.2: web `/v1/auth/refresh`
  retains inlined rotation logic — it does **not** call `rotateTokenFamily()`. Only
  `refresh-body` calls `rotateTokenFamily(app, plain, 'mobile')`.
- Updated `docs/admin-mobile-phase2-plus-plan.md` §4.8: shared `uploadAsset()` helper
  excludes garment types; garment-type upload documented as thumbnail-only
  (`presign → PUT → POST /admin/assets/garment-types`).

**Deferred:**
- 429 rate-limit responses display generic "Invalid credentials" messaging for now.
  Proper "Too many attempts — try again later" handling is Phase 2+ backlog.

---

### 2026-06-12 — Admin Mobile Phases 2-8 implementation plan

**Done:**
- Created `docs/admin-mobile-phase2-plus-plan.md` — detailed implementation plan for
  all remaining phases (2-8), covering ~61 new files across 41 screens:
  - **Shared prerequisites:** StatusBadge, ConfirmDialog, FilterChips, EmptyState,
    SkeletonLoader, PullToRefresh, Toast, useApi/usePagination/useSSE hooks,
    SSE lib, format lib, thumbnail lib, TypeScript types
  - **Phase 2 (Dashboard + Jobs):** 8 files — StatCard, WorkerCard, JobCard,
    EventTimeline, real Dashboard, Job list with SSE, Job detail with cancel/retry
  - **Phase 3 (Users):** 4 files — UserRow, GrantCreditsModal, User list, User detail
  - **Phase 4 (Assets Core):** 11 files — AssetCard, AssetRow, UploadProgress,
    ImagePreview, Face/Background list/detail/upload
  - **Phase 5 (Assets Advanced):** 11 files — Garment Types, Poses (face×bg grid),
    Pose Assets (with mapping), WorkflowPicker
  - **Phase 6 (Catalog):** 5 files — CategoryTree, Catalog items, batch upload
  - **Phase 7 (Workflows + Recycle Bin):** 7 files — Workflow list/detail/upload,
    Recycle Bin with tabs (restore/delete)
  - **Phase 8 (Settings + Config):** 4 files — Credit plans CRUD, Config form
  - Each phase includes: build order, data flow, UI states (loading/empty/error),
    and cross-cutting checklist (skeleton, pull-to-refresh, toast, tablet)
  - Navigation wiring plan for `more.tsx` as each phase completes

---

### 2026-06-12 — Admin Mobile Phase 1: Backend endpoints + scaffold

**Done:**
- **Backend (apps/api):** Added 3 mobile auth endpoints to `routes.ts`:
  - `POST /v1/auth/login-mobile` — body-based login with admin_users check, returns `{ accessToken, refreshToken }` in JSON
  - `POST /v1/auth/refresh-body` — body-based token rotation, reuses shared `rotateTokenFamily()` function
  - `POST /v1/auth/logout-mobile` — body-based logout, revokes refresh token family via `revokedAt`
  - Extracted `rotateTokenFamily()` from `/v1/auth/refresh` to avoid duplication
  - All 3 endpoints have rate limiting, Zod body schemas, and no cookie usage
  - Existing `/v1/auth/refresh` refactored to call shared function — identical behavior
- **Types (packages/types):** Added `build:cjs` script + `require` export condition for Metro bundler compatibility
- **Scaffold (apps/admin-mobile):** Created Expo SDK 53 project with:
  - `package.json` — full deps (Expo 53, React Native 0.79, React 19, Zustand, etc.)
  - `app.config.js` — Android-only, `usesCleartextTraffic` for dev, image-picker + media-library plugins
  - `metro.config.js` — SVG transformer + `@aivastra/types` CJS resolver
  - `tsconfig.json` — standalone, extends `expo/tsconfig.base`
  - `babel.config.js` — with reanimated plugin
- **Foundation files:**
  - `src/styles/tokens.ts` — Colors, Spacing, Radius, Typography (ported from admin CSS)
  - `src/store/auth.ts` — Zustand store: login, logout, bootstrap, SecureStore persistence
  - `src/store/theme.ts` — Zustand store: dark/light toggle, AsyncStorage persistence
  - `src/lib/api.ts` — `apiFetch()` with 401 → refresh-body → retry interceptor
  - `src/lib/roles.ts` — `canAccessAssets()`, `canManageUsers()`, `isSuperAdmin()` helpers
- **Screens:**
  - `src/app/_layout.tsx` — Root layout: GestureHandlerRootView, auth gate, AppState foreground refresh
  - `src/app/(auth)/login.tsx` — Login screen: email/password form, error states, dark theme
  - `src/app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx` — 4-tab bottom navigator with role-based Assets tab visibility
  - Placeholder screens: `home.tsx`, `jobs.tsx`, `assets.tsx`, `more.tsx` (with logout)

**Typecheck:** Passes cleanly (both `@aivastra/api` mobile endpoints and `@aivastra/admin-mobile`)

**Open Questions / Decisions:**
- Pre-existing type errors in `admin/guard.ts`, `admin/users.routes.ts`, and `auth/routes.ts` (`request-admin`) — all from `status` column removed in migration 0039. Not related to mobile work.

---

### 2026-06-12 — Admin Mobile plan review (round 2)

**Done:**
- Addressed 10 remaining issues from second review:
  - Bumped Expo from SDK 52 to **SDK 53** (React Native 0.78, New Architecture default)
  - Bumped all dependency versions for SDK 53 compatibility (expo ~53, react-native-svg ~15.11, reanimated ~3.17, etc.)
  - Added §1.6: New Architecture compatibility checklist
  - Added §1.7: Root `pnpm dev` exclusion (mobile app not started by workspace runner)
  - Fixed §4.2 Dashboard: workers now call `/admin/workers` separately (`/admin/stats` workers have no name/GPU)
  - Fixed §4.2 Dashboard: `failed24h` has no server-provided delta — documented as standalone count
  - Added §4.7: asset-type → presign endpoint mapping table (6 endpoints with response shapes)
  - Added §4.4 dev note: job detail images use public URLs, MinIO 127.0.0.1 unreachable from physical devices
  - Added explicit SSE path `/admin/jobs/stream` in §4.3
  - Added §3.2: `AppState` foreground token refresh listener in root layout

---

### 2026-06-12 — Admin Mobile plan review (round 1)

**Done:**
- Created comprehensive implementation plan at `docs/admin-mobile-implementation.md`
  for a React Native (Expo) admin app (`apps/admin-mobile`)
- Plan covers: project scaffold, 4-tab navigation, auth flow (body-based tokens),
  ~46 screens across 8 phases, component library, styling system, file migration map
- Addressed all 12 issues from plan review:
  - Two new backend endpoints needed: `/v1/auth/login-mobile` and `/v1/auth/refresh-body`
    (both return refresh tokens in JSON body — mobile can't read HTTP-only cookies)
  - Metro bundler ESM workaround: pre-build `@aivastra/types` to CJS + `metro.config.js` resolver
  - Removed `react-native-event-source`, committed to custom fetch-based SSE reader
  - Added missing deps: `expo-media-library`, `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage`, `react-native-gesture-handler`
  - Fixed Android minimum to single value (12+), removed contradiction
  - Added role helper functions (`canAccessAssets`, `canManageUsers`, `isSuperAdmin`)
  - Concrete CI pipeline with EAS Build + `EXPO_TOKEN` secret
  - `app.config.js` pattern for dev/staging/prod API URL switching
  - Phase 9 "Polish" deleted — skeleton/empty state/error boundaries threaded into each phase's deliverable

**Open Questions / Decisions:**
- None — all review issues resolved, plan ready for Phase 1 execution

---

### 2026-06-12 — Admin Mobile plan review (round 1 fixes)

### 2026-06-09 — Production deployment & nginx fixes

**Done**
- Ran `pnpm db:migrate` manually on VPS — migrations 0033–0036 applied (`model_pose_assets`, backfill, face/bg/workflow FKs, `display_name` column)
- Raised nginx `client_max_body_size` from 50m → 300m → 2500m on VPS to unblock ZIP bulk import (242MB+ uploads)
- Raised Fastify multipart `fileSize` limit to 2.5 GB (`chore(api): 487c9d5`)
- Identified CI auto-deploy was broken (git pull prompting for credentials); manual pull + deploy performed

**Open Questions**
- Fix CI auto-deploy: VPS `git pull` fails without credentials — likely `VPS_SSH_KEY` / GitHub token secret issue in GitHub Actions

---

### 2026-06-09 — Pose assets separation

**Done**
- `feat(db): model_pose_assets table` — migration 0033; centralised R2 object ownership; `model_poses.poseAssetId FK` added; backfill creates one asset row per distinct `r2_key` from existing poses
- `feat(api): pose-assets endpoints` — `GET /admin/assets/pose-assets`, `DELETE /admin/assets/pose-assets/:id` (blocked if mappings exist; deletes R2 on success)
- `feat(admin): bulk delete poses removes mappings only` — no R2 cleanup on pose mapping delete; single pose delete same
- `feat(admin): Pose Assets tab` — grid view of all `model_pose_assets` rows with delete confirmation; gender filter applies
- `feat(admin): bulk-import creates asset rows` — each imported pose file gets a `model_pose_assets` row with correct `faceSideR2Key`/`bgComfyR2Key` before mapping row insert

---

### 2026-06-09 — Bulk ZIP asset import

**Done**
- `feat(admin): bulk ZIP asset import endpoint + UI` — admin can upload a ZIP containing `backgrounds/`, `faces/`, and `poses/` folders; server extracts with `adm-zip`, uploads each image directly to R2 via new `putObject` storage method, inserts DB rows for faces/backgrounds/poses; pose filenames `faceXXbgYposeZZ.png` parsed to link to correct face+bg rows; returns `{ created, errors }` summary
- `feat(storage): add putObject to StorageProvider interface + R2 impl` — server-side direct R2 upload without presigned URL flow
- `feat(api): register @fastify/multipart with 250MB limit` for ZIP upload handling
- `feat(admin): Bulk Import ZIP button in garment-type subview header` — modal with ZIP picker, gender select, garment type + workflow dropdowns, progress spinner, result toast on success

---

### 2026-06-09 — Admin pose management improvements

**Done**
- `fix(admin): dedup pose clone by r2Key instead of face+bg combo` — clone skip condition changed from `(subcategoryId, faceId, backgroundId)` to `(subcategoryId, r2Key)`; multiple poses sharing same face+bg but different images now all clone correctly (ab56b07, 17c7a4a)
- `fix(admin): add BrowserRouter basename so /panel/ prefix is preserved on navigation` — admin SPA navigation no longer drops the `/panel/` prefix on route changes (e16b281)
- `feat(admin): bulk delete poses + cascading filter options` — "Delete selected (N)" danger button with warning modal; face/background filter dropdowns now cascade (selecting face narrows bg options to only those paired with that face, and vice versa) (ab56b07)

---

### 2026-06-07 — Admin improvements

**Done**
- `feat(admin): show ComfyUI input images in job detail + refresh button` — job detail view now shows all ComfyUI input images (face, pose, background, garment, lower, shoes); refresh button reloads job state without full page reload (20ed37d)
- `feat(admin): guard admin accounts from suspension/deletion + show Admin badge` — admin users cannot be banned or deleted from the users panel; Admin badge shown on their row (578ca42)
- `fix(ci): pass GITHUB_TOKEN to VPS git pull to fix HTTPS auth failure` — deploy pipeline was failing on git pull due to missing auth token (7d4a687)

---

### 2026-06-05 — Payments, credit plans, admin routing, web production pass

**Done**

*Payments & credits*
- `feat(payments): admin-controlled credit plans via DB` — credit plans stored in `credit_plans` table (migration 0028/0029); admin UI to create/edit/delete plans; plans drive pricing page (9648f93)
- `feat: Razorpay payments, resolution pricing, UX polish & production hardening` — server-side Razorpay order creation + HMAC-SHA256 signature verification; `payments` table (migration 0027) with GST breakdown (18%); HD=25cr / 2K=35cr / 4K=40cr per pose; resolution selector redesigned as radio pills; credit cost shown in studio footer (7b6f3a6)
- `fix(db): register credit_plans migrations in drizzle journal` — migrations 0028/0029 missing from journal (353b27a)

*Admin routing*
- `feat(admin): URL-based routing + pricing GST layout fix` — admin SPA switched to URL-based routing (React Router); pricing GST layout corrected (7c6a8ed)
- `feat(admin): set prod base path to /panel/` — avoids conflict with `/admin/*` API routes in production nginx (ae73677)
- `fix(web): clear NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_PATH runtime default, update domain refs` (d74a39b)

*Web production pass*
- `feat(web): production-readiness + perceived-performance pass` — error boundaries + not-found page; ConfirmDialog replaces native confirm(); loading skeletons on all routes; React Query tuning (staleTime 5m); prefetch on hover; server-side cover URL presigning in `/v1/catalogues` to kill N+1; Download All wired; responsive to 768px (f7a966c)
- `feat(web): redesign auth pages with centered black-bg card layout` (b286a5d)
- `fix(api): cast req.body to CreateTryOnJobRequest in tryon route` (f5f5b0b)
- `fix(web): guard ResizeObserver entry width against undefined` (ae50eb7)

---

### 2026-06-04 — Observability, workflow size patching, CI/deploy fixes

**Done**
- `feat(observability): add M1 metrics + logs pipeline to Grafana Cloud` — new `packages/observability` with prom-client registry; domain metrics (http_request_duration, jobs_created, credits_deducted/refunded, job_processing_duration, queue_depth, workers_healthy); GET /metrics on API + dispatcher; Grafana Alloy agent container in docker-compose.prod.yml; dashboard JSON; docs/observability.md (ad16793)
- `feat(workflow): PrimitiveInt size patching, wider modal, 1:1 → 2048px` — dispatcher patcher supports PrimitiveInt size nodes (sizeNodeIds[0]=width, sizeNodeIds[1]=height); 1:1 ratio changed to 2048×2048 (8b1284f)
- `fix(workflow): revert 1:1 aspect ratio back to 1536×1536` — 2048 caused OOM on GPU; reverted (cc15ebf)
- `fix(api): filter backgrounds by garment type in /v1/models/backgrounds` (ecafa01)
- `fix(docker): build @aivastra/observability in api and dispatcher images` (57f54ea)
- `fix(ci): build @aivastra/observability before typecheck and tests` (48c38f0)
- `fix(ci): add safe.directory before git pull on VPS` (9b8085d)

---

### 2026-06-08 — Auth refresh token family fix (logout race condition)

**Done**
- Migration `0032_refresh_token_family.sql`: added `family_id`, `generation`, `used_at`, `revoked_at`; backfilled; added `UNIQUE(token_hash)`, `UNIQUE(family_id, generation)`, partial unique index `refresh_tokens_one_active_per_family` (with explicit comment on why `expires_at` is excluded), and `family_id` index
- Updated `packages/db/src/schema/users.ts` `refreshTokens` table with new columns (kept `revoked` boolean for backward compat)
- Renamed `issueTokens()` → `createSessionTokens()` in `tokens.ts`; documented "session creation ONLY"; added `familyId: crypto.randomUUID()` and `generation: 1`
- Rewrote `/v1/auth/refresh` in `routes.ts` as self-contained rotation (no `createSessionTokens` call):
  - `FOR UPDATE` lock on presented token row only
  - Transaction wraps `mark used` + `insert successor`; JWT/signing stays outside
  - Grace window (3s): concurrent tab reuse of just-used token finds latest active successor via `ORDER BY generation DESC LIMIT 1` and gets reissued (200, no cookie change)
  - Stale replay outside grace window logs `REFRESH_TOKEN_STALE` and returns 401 without revoking family
- Rewrote `/v1/auth/logout` to revoke entire family (`revokedAt` on all rows matching `family_id`)
- Updated password change + reset + admin suspend/delete to use `revokedAt` instead of `revoked`
- Full audit: zero remaining `revoked: true` writes in the entire codebase
- Updated `apps/web/src/lib/api.ts`:
  - BroadcastChannel listens for `token-refreshed`, writes `access_token` cookie for other tabs
  - `getToken()` consumes `broadcastToken` before falling back to `document.cookie`
  - Current tab explicitly writes its own `access_token` cookie via `setAccessTokenCookie()` after successful refresh (does not rely on BFF alone or BroadcastChannel echo)
  - Posts `token-refreshed` to other tabs after successful refresh
- Added auth integration tests (written but **not executed** — Docker unavailable): concurrent refresh, replay outside grace, logout family revocation, grace window reissue
- Typecheck: clean rebuild of `@aivastra/db` → API auth code typechecks; 4 pre-existing errors remain in unrelated files (`ClonePoseBody`, `lowerGarmentKey`, `platform`)
- Lint: only warnings on changed files (pre-existing `any` types, intentional `document.cookie` writes, non-null assertions in regex parsing); zero new errors

**Failed / Not Done**
- Integration tests were **written but never executed**. Docker Desktop is not running (`ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:5432`). Tests compile but validation is pending. This is a hard blocker before merge.
- `window.location.href` navigation on auth failure remains (pre-existing, out of scope for this PR)

**Open Questions / Decisions**
- Two-phase migration recommended: Deploy 0032 + observe `REFRESH_TOKEN_STALE`/`REFRESH_TOKEN_REISSUE` metrics for 1-2 weeks before dropping `revoked` column in 0033
- Cookie Store API is not widely supported enough to replace `document.cookie` for BroadcastChannel sync. Keeping manual string construction.

**Merge Gate (must pass before merge)**
1. `pnpm docker:up` → `node apps/api/node_modules/vitest/vitest.mjs run test/integration/auth.test.ts`
2. Verify concurrent refresh: 5 requests → 1 rotated, 4 reissued, 0 failures
3. Verify logout family revocation: G1→G2, logout, G2 refresh → 401
4. Verify replay outside grace: G1→G2, wait >3s, reuse G1 → 401, G2 still works

---

### 2026-06-08 — Studio wizard auto-select defaults + pose clone gap analysis

**Done**
- Studio wizard: auto-select first garment type, face/model, background, resolution (HD), lower garment, shoes on data load
- Fixed garment type click handler to cascade-clear downstream selections (face, bg, poses, lower, shoes)
- Maintained pose selection as user-driven multi-select (not auto-selected)
- Typecheck + lint clean

**Open Questions**
- Pose clone gaps documented (R2 key sharing, missing faceSideR2Key/bgComfyR2Key cleanup, no DB unique constraint, no gender validation, no transaction). Fixes not yet implemented.

---

### 2026-06-08 — AGENTS.md refresh

**Done**
- Updated `AGENTS.md` to reflect current repo state: added `@aivastra/observability`, `apps/dispatcher`, `apps/web`, `apps/admin` to monorepo boundaries table
- Removed stale "dispatcher (not yet built)" text; added full dispatcher role, web BFF auth pattern, and package build order to invariants
- Added gotchas: lefthook git hooks, CI auto-deploy on master push, web/admin lack test scripts, web is not ESM
- Added lint/format tool (Biome) to Stack section

---

### 2026-06-03 — Aspect ratio cleanup, presign bug fix, CI/deploy fixes

**Done**
- `1:1` default size updated to 2048×2048 (studio UI + dispatcher patcher)
- Removed aspect ratios `3:2`, `9:16` (Etsy-only); kept `1:1`, `3:4`, `4:5`; removed Etsy platform filter
- Shopify restored with its supported ratios (`1:1`, `4:5`)
- Fixed pose edit modal: `presign-faceside` and `presign-bgcomfy` endpoints were returning full `PresignResult` object as `uploadUrl` instead of `.url` string — XHR PUT received `[object Object]`, silently failed, PATCH never reached
- System design doc (`virtual-tryon-system-design.md`) rewritten to v3 as-built; HTML render added (`virtual-tryon-system-design.html`)
- `lefthook.yml` pre-push lint hook changed to `--diagnostic-level=error` (pre-existing a11y warnings no longer block push)
- `biome.json` excludes `docs/*.html` from lint (generated HTML with inlined minified JS)
- Deploy SSH timeout diagnosed: VPS was returning IPv6 via `ifconfig.me`; IPv4 `72.61.171.138` found and `VPS_HOST` secret updated; new ed25519 deploy key generated and added to `authorized_keys`

**Open Questions / Decisions**
- GitHub Actions deploy still timing out after IP + key fix — Hostinger panel-level firewall suspected (separate from UFW which shows port 22 open to anywhere); `fail2ban` has 0 currently banned IPs

---

### 2026-06-02 — Pose grid coverage warnings, workflow detection, image replace, deploy migrations

**Done**

*Garment-type pose grid (admin)*
- Highlight pose tiles when workflow requires lower/shoe (`lowerNodeId`/`shoeNodeId` set) but no active catalog item of that type is assigned to the current garment subcategory — amber outline + `⚠ lower missing` / `⚠ shoes missing` badges; green/blue `✓` badges when covered (41a2519)
- Filter face/background dropdowns to only items actually used by poses in that garment type; sort pose tiles + background/pose dropdowns alphabetically by label; removed `#N` prefix from pose dropdown options (e9f53dc)
- Background created inline during pose upload now inherits the subcategory `genderSlug` instead of defaulting to null/"all" (a08337d)

*Workflow + asset management (admin)*
- Workflow selector added to pose edit modal (dbdb3db)
- Smarter ComfyUI workflow detection (title + KSampler connection tracing); enforce required size/aspect fields on upload (a555ed6)
- Replace-image action on faces, backgrounds, lower/shoe catalog items; fixed catalog visibility (6c93c5d, dc256a3)

*Infra / DX*
- Auto-migrate on deploy; pre-push hook hard-blocks push when local DB is behind unapplied migrations (fd70a00)
- Untracked `templates/` folder from git; fixed `.gitignore` templates entry (0d41305, 53928dc)
- `apps/web`: added `jszip` dep + type annotation on zip progress callback (42b0131)

**Open Questions / Decisions**
- `0026_catalog_item_subcategories.sql` changed to `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` (idempotent re-apply) + docs edit — locally modified, not yet committed

---

### 2026-06-01 — Auth hardening, email verification, workflow tooling, studio/catalogue UX

**Done**

*Auth*
- Email verification + password reset via Resend (token in Redis, `email_verified` column, verify/reset/forgot/resend routes, web pages) (741ba4f)
- Stopped random user logouts: silent refresh + single-flight token refresh (c0f5419)
- 1h idle session timeout (a5daccd)

*Catalog / workflow (admin)*
- Subcategory-driven lower/shoe linking replaces per-pose allowlists (`catalog_item_subcategories`) (4ea7703)
- Removed `isTemplate` feature; improved pose tile UI (bd1776f); workflow label/slug edit + pose tile workflow badge fix (9477392)
- Workflow detail modal: node mappings, prompts, raw JSON (1fe4833)
- Pose / bgComfy re-upload; improved edit modal UI, prompt labels, thumbnails (f6665b9, 6913cee)
- Assets list API: unique garments with thumbnail presigning + preview UI (a3b1a6e)

*Studio / catalogues (web)*
- Garment type selection redesigned with modal; aspect ratio selection (731ddc9, a94b89a)
- Live platform preview (Amazon mobile + web view) with fidelity/density/zoom polish (88effda, 9ec9f4a, e7ca173)
- Catalogues: date filter, filters, select-all, download-all (403eed6, 894bf81)
- Studio UX improvements + catalogue/assets consistency (36e35f7)
- Image display + garment modal UX refinements (ab02db8)

*Credits / DB*
- Synced admin credit plans with frontend pricing packs (7433a99)
- Applied pending migrations 0023–0026; fixed local dev startup; warn on push when origin has unpulled migrations (af170d0, 4e03c18)

---

### 2026-06-01 — Fix admin Docker build TS errors

**Done**
- `apps/admin/src/lib/data.ts`: added `subcategoryIds: []` to all 7 `MOCK_CATALOG` items — `CatalogItem` type requires this field (added in 2026-06-01 refactor but mocks not updated)
- `apps/admin/src/pages/CatalogPage.tsx`: added `GarmentType` import + `garmentTypes` state, fetched from `/admin/assets/garment-types` alongside existing Promise.all, passed `garmentTypes` prop to `BatchCatalogUploadModal` (prop was required but missing — caused TS2741)
- Docker admin build passes; pushed to master

---

### 2026-06-01 — Reverse catalog item linking: subcategory-driven instead of pose-driven

**Done**
- Replaced `pose_catalog_items` table with `catalog_item_subcategories` (migration 0025)
- Lower/shoe catalog items now declare which garment subcategories they apply to
- Removed lower/shoe item allowlists from PoseUploadModal and EditPoseModal
- Added `showsLower`/`showsShoes` toggle switches to EditPoseModal (per-pose override)
- BatchCatalogUploadModal: added subcategory checklist (shared for all items in batch)
- AssetsPage catalog item edit modal: added subcategory checklist
- Public catalog query updated: given poseIds where showsLower/showsShoes=true, resolves subcategoryIds and returns catalog items linked to those subcategories
- All typechecks pass (DB, types, api, admin)

**Open Questions / Decisions**
- CatalogPage (standalone catalog management page) edit modal still only has gender field — does not have subcategory selection. Can add if needed.

---

### 2026-05-28 — Catalog gender filtering, per-pose allowlist, code quality tooling

#### Done

**Catalog gender simplification**
- Removed `categoryId` as a required field on catalog items — `type` (`lower`|`shoe`) and `genderSlug` stored directly on `catalog_items`
- Removed "All genders" option from upload modal; admin must pick one of 4 genders (men/women/boys/girls)
- Replaced Category column with Gender badge in catalog table
- Added gender edit button (pencil icon) for existing lower/shoe items (`PATCH /admin/catalog/items/:id`)
- Migration `0021_catalog_item_direct_type.sql`: adds `type` column, backfills from `catalog_types`, drops `NOT NULL` on `category_id`
- Deleted 2 null-gender shoe items (nulled `job_inputs` FK first)

**Per-pose catalog item allowlist** (migration `0022`)
- New `pose_catalog_items(pose_id, catalog_item_id)` join table — cascade deletes
- `GET /admin/assets/poses`: returns `lowerItemIds[]` + `shoeItemIds[]` per pose
- `POST /admin/assets/poses/confirm` + `PATCH /:id`: accept and persist item ID lists in transaction
- `GET /v1/catalog/:type?poseIds=...`: returns only items in the pose's allowlist when poseIds provided
- Upload/edit pose modals: `showsLower`/`showsShoes` default **off**; enabling shows scrollable checkbox list filtered by pose gender
- Studio page: catalog queries pass selected pose IDs; lower/shoe sections hidden when no pose enables them

**Gender-filtered catalog in pose modals**
- Upload modal: shows only items matching `garmentTypeGenderSlug`
- Edit modal: derives gender from selected face, filters accordingly

**Code quality tooling (Biome + lefthook)**
- Replaced Prettier with **Biome** (single tool: lint + format, ruff equivalent for TS)
- `biome.json`: 2-space indent, single quotes, recommended lint rules; a11y rules downgraded to warn for admin/web UI
- `pnpm lint` / `pnpm lint:fix` / `pnpm format` scripts at root and per-package
- **lefthook**: pre-commit checks staged `.ts/tsx/json/css` files; pre-push runs lint + typecheck + unit tests
- CI split into 3 parallel jobs: lint, typecheck, test
- All 155 source files reformatted

**Build fixes**
- `MOCK_POSES` in `apps/admin/src/lib/data.ts` missing `lowerItemIds`/`shoeItemIds` → Docker build failed
- Biome stripped `.js` ESM extension from `packages/storage/test/keys.test.ts` → typecheck failed

#### Failed / Not Done
- Server migration `0022_pose_catalog_items` must be applied after next deploy: `pnpm --filter @aivastra/db migrate`

#### Open Questions / Decisions
- Studio currently shows all lower/shoe items when no poseIds provided (legacy tree path). Once all poses have allowlists configured, this legacy path can be removed.

---

### 2026-05-28 — ComfyUI results monitor page (standalone admin endpoint)

Standalone read-only results monitor at `/results` for admins to visually inspect ComfyUI outputs across all users, matching the legacy webtool screenshot layout.

#### Done
- **New API module:** `apps/api/src/modules/results/routes.ts`
  - `GET /results` — self-contained HTML page with inline CSS + vanilla JS (auto light/dark theme, rich UX: filters, pagination, lightbox, image lazy-loading, shimmer skeletons, toast notifications, logout button).
  - `POST /results/login` — independent admin login using same email/password credentials. Issues `results_access_token` cookie scoped to `/results` (isolated from admin app cookies).
  - `POST /results/logout` — clears the results cookie.
  - `GET /results/data` — paginated JSON with public image URLs for Garment, Pose, Background, Shoes, and Output; supports `search`, `userId`, `date` (`any`/`today`/`7d`/`30d`), and `status` (`completed`/`failed`/`all`).
  - `GET /results/users` — distinct user list for the User filter dropdown.
  - Independent cookie-based auth (`requireResultsUser`) verifies admin role (`SUPER_ADMIN`/`MODERATOR`/`SUPPORT`) without sharing session state with the admin React app.
  - Read-only: no delete or mutation actions.
- **Server wiring:** `apps/api/src/server.ts` — one import + `await app.register(resultsRoutes);`.
- **Zero impact** on `apps/web`, `apps/admin`, DB schema, or env files.
- **Typecheck + build green** for `@aivastra/api`.

#### Open Questions / Decisions
- Lower-garment thumbnail is not shown as a separate column (matches the 5-column screenshot layout: Garment, Pose, Background, Shoes, Output).
- Image downloads rely on browser `download` attribute + same-origin/CORS behavior of the configured R2 public URL.

### 2026-05-26 — Full user frontend rebuild from scratch (vastra3.0 design)

Spec: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-26-frontend-rebuild-vastra-3-design.md`. Rebuilt the entire user-facing frontend from the Claude Design handoff (`vastra.html`), inline-token styling, new route structure. Wired to existing `/v1` API.

#### Done
- **Foundation:** `components/tokens.ts` (C palette + grad), `components/icons.tsx` (all design SVGs), `components/logo.tsx`, `components/ui/{grad-btn,dark-btn,google-btn,divider}.tsx`, `components/step-indicator.tsx`, `components/topbar.tsx` (self-contained). `globals.css` replaced with minimal reset + Poppins + scrollbar (dropped Tailwind directives + 895-line class system). Root layout: removed dark-mode script + Inter/JetBrains fonts.
- **App shell:** `(app)/layout.tsx` = dark sidebar + main column (TopbarProvider removed). New `sidebar.tsx` on routes studio/catalogues/assets/pricing/settings, keeps `/v1/credits` + `/v1/me` wiring.
- **Routes restructured:** `/studio` (was tryon), `/catalogues` (was dashboard) + `/catalogues/[id]`, `/assets` + `/assets/[id]`, `/pricing` (was credits), `/settings` (was account).
- **Studio:** 4-step wizard re-skin of tryon logic — gender→outfit+garment upload→models→backgrounds→poses(+lower/shoes)→generate. Submits `POST /v1/jobs/tryon` → `/catalogues/:id`.
- **Settings:** 4 tabs. Profile wired `GET/PATCH /v1/me`. Credit History wired `GET /v1/credits` (summary derived from `recent`). Billing + Invoices stubbed (disabled inputs).
- **Catalogues:** list (date-grouped, cover via `/v1/jobs/:id/result`, polls active) + detail (image grid, per-image fullscreen lightbox + download + delete).
- **Pricing:** static 3-col plan table + Razorpay test-mode stub (`NEXT_PUBLIC_RAZORPAY_KEY`).
- **Cleanup:** deleted `(app)/{tryon,dashboard,credits,account,jobs}`, `context/topbar-context.tsx`, `components/{navbar,theme-toggle}.tsx`, `components/ui/{button,badge,input}.tsx`. Middleware redirects old paths → new. Root redirect → `/studio`.
- **Verified:** `next build` green — all 15 routes generated; `/login` serves 200.

#### Failed / Not Done
- Assets list/detail are mocked (no backend endpoint) — tagged `TODO(wire)`.
- Pricing top-up needs a backend order-creation route; current Razorpay call is a client-only test stub.
- Billing/Invoices settings tabs have no backend.
- Studio wizard state is in-memory (lost on refresh) — per locked decision.
- No browser smoke test of authenticated flows (build + static `/login` only).

#### Open Questions / Decisions
- `qty`/`quality` in studio are UI-only; `POST /v1/jobs/tryon` charges per-pose. Credit math shown (`poses × qty × quality`) is cosmetic until backend accepts those params.
- Razorpay test stub bypasses server order verification — must wire `/credits/topup` + signature check before production.

---

### 2026-05-26 — Web UI restyle (vastra3.0 design)

#### Done
- Root redirect: landing page replaced with auth-aware redirect (logged in → /tryon, else → /login)
- `apps/web/src/app/home/page.tsx` deleted
- Logo assets copied to `apps/web/public/assets/` (logo-icon, logo-icon-large, logo-wordmark, logo-wordmark-large, auth-bg)
- New CSS utility classes added to `globals.css`: `.av-auth-shell`, `.av-auth-form-col`, `.av-auth-image-col`, `.av-auth-divider`, `.av-btn-dark`, `.av-btn-grad`, `.av-topbar`, `.av-pricing-table` (+ sub-classes), `.av-cat-date-group`, `.av-assets-grid`, `.av-asset-card`
- Sidebar: new nav (Studio/Catalogues/Assets/Pricing/Settings), PNG logo, credits widget, logout icon — dark mode toggle removed
- Auth pages: two-column layout (600px form + auth-bg.png image panel) for login and register; Google button (UI only)
- Assets page: new `/assets` route with mock garment data grid (UI only)
- Pricing page: full plan comparison table (Starter/Growth/Pro) above existing credit request form
- Catalogues: date-grouped catalogue grid, new TopBar with "Create Catalogue" gradient button + search bar
- View Catalogue: new TopBar with back arrow + "Download All" button
- Studio: new TopBar with 4-step stepper (Setup / AI Models / Backgrounds / Generate), old `av-page-head` + `av-stepper` replaced
- Settings/Account: renamed tabs (Profile Details / Billing / Credit History / Invoices), new TopBar with Log Out button

#### Open Questions
- Google OAuth: button renders on auth pages but no wiring (intentional for now)
- Assets page: needs real API endpoint for listing/uploading user garments
- Pricing "Buy" buttons: UI only, no payment integration yet

---

### 2026-05-23 (uncommitted) — Multi-pose per job + catalogue grouping

**Done**

- `api`: `POST /v1/jobs/tryon` now accepts `poseIds` array (1–6); creates 1 job per pose under shared `catalogueId`; partial enqueue failure handling (refund + fail individual jobs, throw only if all fail)
- `api`: `GET /v1/catalogues` — groups jobs by `catalogueId`, newest first, 200 limit
- `api`: `GET /v1/catalogues/:id` — all jobs for one catalogue, ordered by `createdAt`
- `db`: migration `0007_catalogue_id.sql` — `ALTER TABLE jobs ADD COLUMN catalogue_id uuid`
- `db/schema/jobs.ts`: added `catalogueId` column
- `types`: `CreateTryOnJobRequest.inputs.poseId` → `poseIds: z.array(z.string().uuid()).min(1).max(6)`
- `web`: catalogue detail page scaffolded at `apps/web/src/app/(app)/catalogues/[id]/page.tsx`
- `web`: catalogue grid CSS (`.av-cdet-grid`, `.av-cdet-card`, `.av-cdet-img`, `.av-cdet-footer`) in globals.css
- `web`: dashboard — live data fetch, image grid with lazy thumbnails, status badges
- `web`: wizard — multi-pose selection UI (checkboxes, count badge)
- `web`: cleanup — replace hardcoded `#FFF` with CSS vars, dropzone bg uses `--surface-2`

**Failed / Not Done**

- Catalogue listing page (`GET /v1/catalogues`) only returns job metadata — no output thumbnails, no preview in catalogue grid
- Dashboard still uses mock stats (not live aggregate from API)
- Migration 0007 not yet applied to dev DB
- `apps/web/src/app/(app)/catalogues/[id]/page.tsx` — needs full UI polish

**Open Questions / Decisions**

- [ ] Catalogue page UX: show first output thumbnail per catalogue? Show status summary (X done / Y total)?
- [ ] Jobs detail page redesign — still old sketch palette

---

### 2026-05-22 → 2026-05-23 — End-to-end pipeline + lower garments + theme toggle + account page

**Done**

*Dispatcher pipeline fixed (end-to-end)*

- Fixed `WORKER_A_URL` protocol + port (`http://38.247.187.234:8000`)
- Added `setGlobalDispatcher` TLS bypass for undici (`NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED`)
- Fixed stream consumer `BLOCK 0` deadlock on `jobs:priority` queue
- Switched `waitForCompletion` from WebSocket to `/history` polling (more reliable)
- Added `undici` dep, startup connectivity check per worker, info-level WS logs
- Updated workflow patcher to `twopiece.json` node IDs (1332/1333/1334/1340/1331)
- Added lower garment resolution + upload in processor
- Fixed `fetchHistory` to filter `type=output` only
- Workflow template `templates/virtual-tryon-v1.json` now real ComfyUI export (538 lines)

*Wizard step 5 — lower garment + shoes*

- `api`: wire catalog routes for lower garments + shoes (`GET /v1/catalog/items?typeSlug=lower_garments|shoes`)
- `api`: job creation validates `lowerCatalogId` + `shoeCatalogId`
- `db`: seed catalog types (migration `0006`) — `lower_garments`, `shoes`
- `admin`: catalog batch upload modal (`BatchCatalogUploadModal.tsx`) with per-file status + retry
- `admin`: catalog item edit wired (edit button updates label/isActive)
- `admin`: fix "Add item" button always opens modal, hidden on All Items tab
- `web`: wizard step 5 — lower garment + shoes selection carousel, conditionally shown per `pose.showsLower`/`pose.showsShoes`

*Home page + nav*

- Home page (`/`) always visible to unauthenticated users (marketing landing)
- `/home` route alias for sidebar link
- Sidebar `Home` link added

*Theme toggle + sidebar collapse*

- `theme-toggle.tsx` component — sun/moon icon, reads/writes `localStorage.theme`, toggles `dark` class on `<html>`
- Sidebar collapsible: hamburger button, collapsed state shows only icons, `--sidebar-width` CSS var toggles `64px` / `240px`
- TopBar removed — theme toggle + sign-out moved into sidebar

*Account page*

- `apps/web/src/app/(app)/account/page.tsx` — display name, email, tier, credit balance, change password, job history
- Styled with `av-card` layout matching new palette

*Dashboard grid*

- Replaced flat job list with image grid — lazy-loaded output thumbnails, status overlay badges, retry on failed
- Grid layout `.av-dash-grid` with responsive `auto-fill, minmax(220px, 1fr)`

*Admin profile*

- Dynamic sidebar profile section — reads user data from auth context (initials avatar, email)

*Tests*

- `vitest.config.ts` updated for dispatcher (undici mock)

**Failed / Not Done**

- Dashboard stats still mock data (not live aggregate)
- Jobs detail page still old sketch palette
- `apps/web/src/components/navbar.tsx` unused but still exists

**Open Questions / Decisions**

- [ ] Lower garment thumbnail resolution in dispatcher — PNG flatten + upload to R2 confirmed working
- [ ] `/history` polling interval for ComfyUI output — currently 2s, adjust if GPU node overloaded
- [ ] Dispatcher TLS bypass (`NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0`) — needs proper cert in prod

---

### 2026-05-22 — Full frontend redesign (vastra2.0 designer handoff)

**Done**

- `apps/web/src/app/globals.css`: complete rewrite — removed sketch utilities (`sketch-card`, `btn-sketch`, `underline-emph`), added full `av-` CSS class system (sidebar, stepper, cards, chips, dropzone, select, buttons, spinner), CSS vars matching warm cream palette (`--bg: #FBF8F3`, `--peach`, `--amber`, `--mint`, `--grad`, etc.), dark mode support
- `apps/web/src/app/layout.tsx`: replaced Caveat font with Poppins (400/500/600/700/800) + JetBrains Mono; updated metadata
- `apps/web/src/app/page.tsx`: full marketing landing page from `vastra2.0/Home.html` — hero, logos strip, how-it-works (4 steps), features grid, gallery (4 samples), pricing (3 cards), CTA, footer; `lp-` prefixed CSS via inline `<style>` tag; redirects to `/dashboard` if already logged in
- `apps/web/public/samples/`: copied `sample-1..4.png` from `vastra2.0/assets/`
- `apps/web/src/components/sidebar.tsx` (new): dark sidebar with credits bar (`/v1/credits`), user info (`/v1/me`), nav items (Studio/Catalogues/Credits), logout, initials avatar
- `apps/web/src/app/(app)/layout.tsx`: replaced navbar with `<div className="av-app"><Sidebar /><main className="av-main">{children}</main></div>`
- `apps/web/src/app/(app)/tryon/page.tsx`: 4-step wizard (Setup → Models → Backgrounds → Pose+Generate); garment upload starts immediately in step 0; Generate button gated on `garmentKey` set; `useEffect` fix for dropdown outside-click listener
- `apps/web/src/app/(app)/dashboard/page.tsx`: restyled with `av-card`, status dots, badge chips
- `apps/web/src/app/(app)/credits/page.tsx`: restyled with `av-card`, gradient balance display, package selector chips
- `apps/web/src/app/(auth)/login/page.tsx`: clean centered layout, white card, tab pills
- `apps/web/src/app/(auth)/register/page.tsx`: same structure as login
- `apps/api/src/modules/auth/routes.ts`: added `GET /v1/me` endpoint for regular users (email, displayName, tier)

**Failed / Not Done**

- `apps/web/src/components/navbar.tsx`: still exists (unused — safe to delete later)
- `apps/web/src/app/(app)/jobs/[id]/page.tsx`: still uses old sketch design (not redesigned)
- Old UI components (`ui/button.tsx`, `badge.tsx`, `input.tsx`): still present but unused by new design

**Open Questions / Decisions**

- [ ] Jobs detail page (`/jobs/:id`) needs redesign to match new palette
- [ ] Navbar component can be deleted
- [ ] Lower garment step: conditional on `pose.showsLower === true` (still not added)
- [ ] ComfyUI workflow template `templates/virtual-tryon-v1.json` still a stub

---

### 2026-05-22 — Admin panel live data + credit requests + isTemplate + background preview

**Done**

*isTemplate redesign — dropped `subcategoryTemplates` table*

- `packages/db/src/schema/models.ts`: added `isTemplate boolean` to `modelPoses`; partial unique index `(subcategoryId, faceId, backgroundId) WHERE isTemplate=true`; removed `subcategoryTemplates` table
- Migration `0005_pose_istemplate_drop_templates.sql`: `ALTER TABLE model_poses ADD COLUMN is_template`; create index; `DROP TABLE subcategory_templates CASCADE`. Applied directly via `docker exec psql` (drizzle migration tracker only has entries 0+1; 2–5 must be applied manually)
- `packages/types/src/admin.ts`: `ConfirmModelPoseBody` + `PatchModelPoseBody` include `isTemplate`; all subcategory template schemas removed
- `apps/api/src/modules/admin/models.routes.ts`: `POST /poses/confirm` + `PATCH /poses/:id` unset previous template in cell before setting new one (transactional)
- `apps/api/src/modules/admin/subcategories.routes.ts`: `PATCH /subcategories/:id` enforces template coverage (every face×bg cell must have a template) when setting `isActive: true`
- `apps/api/src/server.ts`: removed `adminTemplatesRoutes` import + registration; deleted `templates.routes.ts`
- `BatchPoseUploadModal`: radio button per row to designate template at batch-upload time; default = first file
- `AssetsPage`: removed template tab/cards/state; "Set as template" button on non-template pose cards; pose cards show blue outline + badge when `isTemplate=true`; `templateCount` derived client-side

*Admin Users page — live data*

- `GET /admin/users`: `ilike` search on email/displayName, `total` count, left-join `userCredits` + `jobs` for `balance`/`totalJobs`/`lastJobAt`; excludes `passwordHash`
- `GET /admin/users/:id`: explicit field select (no passwordHash), flat response `{ ...user, balance, totalJobs, recentJobs }`
- `UsersPage.tsx`: replaced MOCK_USERS with `useEffect` + `apiFetch`; server-side search + pagination; suspend/unsuspend via `PATCH /admin/users/:id { isBanned }`; optimistic status update
- `User` type updated: `displayName`, `tier`, `isBanned`, `banReason`, `balance`, `totalJobs`, `lastJobAt`, `createdAt`; removed `name`/`plan`/`role`/`emailVerified`/`creditLimit`/`status`

*Credit Requests page (new)*

- `CreditRequestsPage.tsx`: tabs Pending / Approved / Rejected; approve modal (editable credits amount prefilled, optional admin note) → `PATCH /admin/credits/requests/:id/approve`; reject modal → `PATCH /admin/credits/requests/:id/reject`; reloads list after action
- Wired into `App.tsx` (`'credits'` page) and `Sidebar.tsx` (`Icon.Credit`, visible to SUPER_ADMIN + MODERATOR)

*Admin Jobs page — live data*

- `GET /admin/jobs`: `status` filter, `search` (job ID / user email), `total` count; multi-join for `userEmail`, `faceLabel`, `backgroundLabel`, `poseLabel`, `hasLower`, `hasShoe`, `outputUrl` (via storage.publicUrl)
- `GET /admin/jobs/:id`: same rich join + `userHint` from `jobInputs` + `events` array (flat response, not nested)
- `JobsPage.tsx`: replaced MOCK_JOBS with live fetch; status tab filter + search + pagination; detail view with events log; cancel → `POST .../cancel` with optimistic update; retry button on FAILED jobs → `POST .../retry`
- `Job` type: `userEmail`/timestamps/errorCode now `| null`; added `userId?`, `attempts?`

*User-facing background preview (template showcase)*

- `GET /v1/models/backgrounds`: accepts optional `subcategoryId`; when `faceId + subcategoryId` both provided fetches template poses (`isTemplate=true`) for face×subcategory, builds `backgroundId → thumbnailKey` map; response includes `previewUrl` = template pose composite thumbnail (falls back to raw bg thumbnail if no template set)
- `tryon/page.tsx`: `BackgroundItem` gets `previewUrl`; backgrounds query passes `subcategoryId`; background cards use `previewUrl`; step 2 description updated

**Failed / Not Done**

- Sidebar badge counts for jobs/credits are static (removed fake counts from users/jobs, credits has no live pending count yet)
- Dashboard page (`DashboardPage.tsx`) still uses MOCK_STATS — not converted to live data yet

**Open Questions / Decisions**

- [ ] Lower garment step in wizard: still not added (conditional on `pose.showsLower === true`)
- [ ] ComfyUI workflow template `templates/virtual-tryon-v1.json` still a stub — blocking E2E
- [ ] GPU VPS worker registration + dispatcher start — needed for E2E test

---

### 2026-05-21 — Frontend scaffold complete (Phase 3A+3B+3C) + backend schema fixes

**Done**

*`apps/web` — Next.js 15 App Router (full scaffold)*

- `package.json`: Next.js 15, React 19, Tailwind CSS 3, @tanstack/react-query, react-hook-form + zod resolvers, lucide-react, @radix-ui/react-slot
- `middleware.ts`: route protection via `access_token` cookie; redirects unauthenticated users to `/login?next=<path>`
- **Auth proxy routes** (`/api/auth/*`): Next.js route handlers proxy to API, extract refresh token from `Set-Cookie` response header, re-set as httpOnly cookie at `/api/auth` path; set `access_token` as JS-readable cookie at `/`
  - `/api/auth/login`, `/api/auth/register`, `/api/auth/logout`, `/api/auth/refresh`
- **Auth pages**: `/login`, `/register` — react-hook-form + zod validation, error display, Tailwind styling
- **App layout** (`/(app)/layout.tsx`): sticky navbar with credits balance (live via React Query), logout button, nav links
- **Dashboard** (`/dashboard`): job history list, status badges with icons, auto-refetch every 3s when active jobs exist
- **Try-On Wizard** (`/tryon`): 6-step wizard
  - Step 0: Gender + subcategory picker (loads `GET /v1/models/subcategories?gender=X`)
  - Step 1: Garment upload — XHR with progress bar, presign → direct R2 PUT
  - Step 2: Face selection — card grid (loads `GET /v1/models/faces?gender=X`)
  - Step 3: Background selection — card grid (loads `GET /v1/models/backgrounds`)
  - Step 4: Pose selection — card grid (loads `GET /v1/models/poses?subcategoryId=X&faceId=Y&backgroundId=Z`)
  - Step 5: Review + submit → `POST /v1/jobs/tryon` → redirect to job detail
- **Job detail** (`/jobs/[id]`): SSE live progress (EventSource), step indicator, result image with download button, failure state with refund notice
- **UI components**: Button (asChild/Radix Slot), Input, Badge (success/warning/processing/destructive variants), Navbar, Providers (React Query)
- **API client** (`lib/api.ts`): typed fetch wrapper, auto-refresh on 401, XHR upload with onprogress

*Backend fixes*

- `apps/api/src/modules/models/routes.ts` (NEW): user-facing model routes — `GET /v1/models/subcategories`, `/faces`, `/backgrounds`, `/poses`; requires auth, returns thumbnailUrl via `storage.publicUrl()`; registered in `server.ts`
- `apps/api/src/modules/jobs/create.ts`: rewrote to use new schema — validates `faceId`/`backgroundId`/`poseId` against `model_faces`/`model_backgrounds`/`model_poses` (was broken: still used old `modelCatalogId`/`catalogItems` references)
- `apps/dispatcher/src/job/processor.ts`: fixed r2Key resolution — now reads from `model_faces`/`model_backgrounds`/`model_poses` via `inputs.faceId`/`backgroundId`/`poseId` (was broken: used old `inputs.modelCatalogId` etc. against `catalogItems`)

**Failed / Not Done**

- SSE auth: job events endpoint uses `EventSource` which can't set custom headers; token passed as `?token=` query param in URL. API's `requireUser` plugin needs to support token from query string (not yet implemented — will silently fail on first SSE connect)
- No `CORS_ORIGIN` update for web port 3000 (`.env` still default; should be `http://localhost:3000` — already set)
- `apps/web` not in CORS_ORIGIN of API: need to confirm `CORS_ORIGIN=http://localhost:3000` in `.env`

**Decisions Made**

- Auth cookie strategy: `access_token` non-httpOnly (JS-readable, 15min) + `refresh` httpOnly at `/api/auth` path (7d). All managed by Next.js proxy routes.
- All API calls go direct from client to `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` (not through Next.js proxy), except auth. Avoids latency overhead.
- XHR (not fetch) for garment upload: enables `onprogress` events for progress bar.

**Open Questions / Decisions**

- [ ] SSE auth: `GET /v1/jobs/:id/events` uses `EventSource` (no custom headers). API `requireUser` only reads `Authorization` header. Need to add `?token=<accessToken>` query param support to `requireUser` plugin, or proxy SSE through Next.js.
- [ ] `CORS_ORIGIN` in `.env` must be `http://localhost:3000` for web ↔ API in dev — confirm set.
- [ ] `apps/web` prod: served via CloudPanel nginx on port 3000? Confirm routing before Phase 4D Dockerfile.
- [ ] Catalog lower garment selection not in wizard (Phase 3B only covers face/bg/pose). Add lower garment step if needed (wizard step 5, only shown when `pose.showsLower === true`).

---

### 2026-05-21 — Admin panel complete + asset management system

**Done**

*Admin Panel (`apps/admin` — standalone Vite/React SPA, proxied through Vite dev server at :5173)*

- **AssetsPage** — 3-tab layout: Backgrounds, Faces, Subcategories
  - Backgrounds tab: upload (presign → R2 PUT → confirm), toggle active, delete
  - Faces tab: upload with gender tag (men/women/boys/girls), toggle active, delete
  - Subcategories tab: create (proper modal, replaced `prompt()` dialogs), list with pose grid per subcategory
- **Pose management** — poses are per (subcategory × face × background) combo
  - Single-pose upload via UploadModal
  - Batch upload (`BatchPoseUploadModal`): select multiple files, assign shared face+bg+showsLower+showsShoes metadata, auto-label from filename stem, sequential upload with per-file status + retry
  - `EditPoseModal`: edit label, reassign faceId/backgroundId, showsLower, showsShoes, sortOrder — PATCH `/admin/assets/poses/:id`
  - Filter poses grid by face + background dropdowns
- **CatalogPage** — lower garments + shoes, thumbnail preview, toggle active, delete, upload
- **Real image thumbnails** — `AssetThumb` component: fetches `storagePublicUrl` from `/admin/me`, renders `<img>` using `thumbnailKey`; falls back to initials placeholder
- **AuthContext** — stores `storagePublicUrl: string | null`, propagated from `/admin/me` response, cleared on logout
- **Dark mode** — switch/toggle knob fixed (was hardcoded `#fff`, invisible on light track; now uses `var(--bg)`)
- **UploadModal** — added `placeholder` prop support for all field types

*DB / Types / API*

- `model_poses` schema: added `face_id` + `background_id` FK columns (migration `0003_poses_add_face_bg.sql`), applied to local Docker Postgres
- `packages/types`: `PresignModelPoseBody`, `ConfirmModelPoseBody` include `faceId`+`backgroundId`; `PatchModelPoseBody` has optional `faceId`+`backgroundId`
- `/admin/assets/poses` GET: optional `faceId`/`backgroundId` query filters
- `/admin/me` response: includes `storagePublicUrl` from env
- `packages/storage/r2.ts`: fixed two AWS SDK v3 presigned URL bugs
  - Removed `ContentLength` from `PutObjectCommand` (was signing content-length header, causing `SignatureDoesNotMatch` when file size differed from hardcoded 10MB)
  - Added `requestChecksumCalculation: 'WHEN_REQUIRED'` + `responseChecksumValidation: 'WHEN_REQUIRED'` (disabled CRC32 checksum query params MinIO doesn't support)

**Failed / Not Done**

- Admin panel built as separate Vite SPA (`apps/admin`), not embedded in Next.js (`apps/web`) — diverges from PHASES.md §3D plan. This is intentional: admin panel is ready for production use standalone; no plan to migrate.
- `apps/web` (user-facing Next.js try-on builder) — not started
- Phase 2B (VPS + Tunnel + ComfyUI) — not started
- `templates/virtual-tryon-v1.json` — still a stub; real ComfyUI workflow export still blocking E2E

**Decisions Made**

- Admin panel = standalone Vite SPA (`apps/admin`) — not part of `apps/web`. Deployed separately, proxied by nginx in prod.
- Asset management scope expanded beyond original PHASES.md §1D: model faces, backgrounds, garment subcategories, poses all fully managed via admin UI.
- Poses schema: face × background per pose (not just per subcategory) — data model locked.
- Presigned URL upload flow: browser → presign API → direct PUT to MinIO/R2 → confirm API. Confirmed working end-to-end with local MinIO.

**Open Questions / Decisions**

- [ ] `apps/admin` prod deployment: serves from same VPS as API? nginx route `/admin-app/*` → static files from `apps/admin/dist/`? Decide before Phase 4D.
- [ ] Subcategory template images (`subcategory_templates` table — pre-rendered face×background composites): does admin need UI to upload these? Currently table exists but no admin page for it.
- [ ] Pose `subcategoryId` is required on upload — does every pose belong to exactly one subcategory, or should poses be subcategory-agnostic (shared across subcategories)? Current model: one subcategory per pose. Confirm with product.

---

### 2026-05-19 — Dispatcher test fixes

**Done**
- Fixed postgres module resolution: added `resolve.alias` in `apps/dispatcher/vitest.config.ts` (Vite couldn't resolve `postgres` from non-hoisted pnpm layout)
- Fixed worker registry test isolation: `registerWorkers` now always updates (removed `if (!existing)` guard), added `deregisterWorker` called in all test `afterAll` blocks
- Fixed `recoverPendingJobs`: added optional `streams` param (defaults to `['jobs:priority', 'jobs:normal']`), handles NOGROUP gracefully
- Fixed recovery test: passes custom stream to `recoverPendingJobs` instead of expecting hardcoded streams
- Removed duplicate `export { schema }` from `packages/db/src/index.ts`
- All 3 dispatcher integration test suites pass: happy-path, retry, recovery
- Added `README.md` with architecture, stack, setup, commands, project status
- Pushed all changes to GitHub (`adeshboudh/aivastra`)

**Failed / Not Done**
- `templates/virtual-tryon-v1.json` still a stub — real ComfyUI workflow export needed
- VPS provisioning (Phase 2B) not started
- Phase 3 (`apps/web` Next.js frontend) not started

**Open Questions / Decisions**
- [ ] ComfyUI workflow: which node IDs map to each `__AIVASTRA_*__` placeholder? Need real workflow export first
- [ ] Worker hostname naming: `WORKER_A_URL` / `WORKER_B_URL` vs `WORKER_<ID>_URL` — decide convention before Phase 2B
- [ ] Catalog key resolution still happens in dispatcher via DB join (deviation from CLAUDE.md invariant) — add r2Key columns to `job_inputs` in v2 migration?

### 2026-05-19 — Phase 2 dispatcher plan written

**Done**
- Detailed implementation plan written at `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-05-19-phase-2-dispatcher.md`
- Plan covers 20 tasks: package scaffold, env validation, lib layer, worker registry + health monitor + selector, workflow patcher, ComfyUI HTTP + WebSocket client, job state machine + processor, stream consumer, crash recovery, health server, entry point, test harness + 3 integration test suites, Dockerfile
- Workflow template stub created at `templates/virtual-tryon-v1.json` (placeholder markers defined)

**Failed / Not Done**
- Implementation not started — plan only
- `templates/virtual-tryon-v1.json` is a stub; real ComfyUI workflow export still needed (blocking for Phase 4 E2E)
- VPS provisioning (Phase 2B) not covered in code plan — infra-only, see `infra/cloudflared/README.md`

**Open Questions / Decisions**
- [ ] **BLOCKING:** Real ComfyUI workflow export needed — set up ComfyUI on dev VPS, build workflow, export as API format, map node IDs to `__AIVASTRA_*__` placeholders in template
- [ ] Catalog key resolution deviation: `job_inputs` stores catalog UUIDs, not r2Keys — dispatcher must join `catalog_items`. Consider adding r2Key columns to `job_inputs` in v2 migration
- [ ] Hostinger GPU VPS specs not finalized — confirm plan availability before provisioning (see PHASES.md §2B)
- [ ] `WORKER_IDS` env var naming: `worker-a,worker-b` requires `WORKER_A_URL` and `WORKER_B_URL` env vars — confirm naming convention matches real worker hostnames

### 2026-05-18 — Initial scaffolding (api + packages)

**Done**
- Monorepo structure created: `apps/api`, `packages/db`, `packages/types`, `packages/storage`, `packages/logger`
- Drizzle schema + migrations wired in `packages/db`
- Fastify API with all `/v1/*` and `/admin/*` routes: users, credits, catalog, jobs, workers, config
- JWT auth + admin double-check guard (`admin_users` row lookup)
- Redis Streams job enqueue (`jobs:priority`, `jobs:normal`)
- SSE job events via Redis pub/sub with 15s heartbeat
- Integration test suite: per-test Postgres DB + MinIO bucket isolation, no testcontainers
- Parallel test isolation fixed for db + redis + minio
- Production Dockerfile + e2e smoke test

**Failed / Not Done**
- `apps/dispatcher` — not yet built (Redis Stream consumer, ComfyUI bridge, worker health monitor)
- `apps/web` — not yet scaffolded
- `packages/catalog` — category tree builder not yet extracted
- `scripts/seed-catalog.ts` — not yet written
- Cloudflare Tunnel / `cloudflared` infra config
- ComfyUI workflow templates in `templates/`

**Open Questions / Decisions**
- [ ] Dispatcher: retry strategy — max 2 attempts then refund. Confirm dead-letter stream key name.
- [ ] Web: Next.js 15 App Router vs Pages Router for admin panel?
- [ ] Presigned URL expiry for garment uploads — how long?
- [ ] Worker health TTL is 30s (probed every 15s) — adjust if ComfyUI startup is slow?
- [ ] `packages/catalog` — extract from api routes now or after dispatcher?
- [ ] MinIO bucket naming convention for prod R2 (single bucket with prefixes vs per-env buckets)?
